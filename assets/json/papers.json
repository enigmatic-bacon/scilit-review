    "title": "Interventions for improving upper limb function after stroke",
    "abstract": "Background: Improving upper limb function is a core element of stroke rehabilitation needed to maximise patient outcomes and reduce disability. Evidence about effects of individual treatment techniques and modalities is synthesised within many reviews. For selection of effective rehabilitation treatment, the relative effectiveness of interventions must be known. However, a comprehensive overview of systematic reviews in this area is currently lacking.\nObjectives: To carry out a Cochrane overview by synthesising systematic reviews of interventions provided to improve upper limb function after stroke.\nSearch methods: We comprehensively searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; the Database of Reviews of Effects; and PROSPERO (an international prospective register of systematic reviews) (June 2013). We also contacted review authors in an effort to identify further relevant reviews.\nSelection criteria: We included Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with stroke comparing upper limb interventions with no treatment, usual care or alternative treatments. Our primary outcome of interest was upper limb function; secondary outcomes included motor impairment and performance of activities of daily living. When we identified overlapping reviews, we systematically identified the most up-to-date and comprehensive review and excluded reviews that overlapped with this.\nData collection and analysis: Two overview authors independently applied the selection criteria, excluding reviews that were superseded by more up-to-date reviews including the same (or similar) studies. Two overview authors independently assessed the methodological quality of reviews (using a modified version of the AMSTAR tool) and extracted data. Quality of evidence within each comparison in each review was determined using objective criteria (based on numbers of participants, risk of bias, heterogeneity and review quality) to apply GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) levels of evidence. We resolved disagreements through discussion. We systematically tabulated the effects of interventions and used quality of evidence to determine implications for clinical practice and to make recommendations for future research.\nMain results: Our searches identified 1840 records, from which we included 40 completed reviews (19 Cochrane; 21 non-Cochrane), covering 18 individual interventions and dose and setting of interventions. The 40 reviews contain 503 studies (18,078 participants). We extracted pooled data from 31 reviews related to 127 comparisons. We judged the quality of evidence to be high for 1/127 comparisons (transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) demonstrating no benefit for outcomes of activities of daily living (ADLs)); moderate for 49/127 comparisons (covering seven individual interventions) and low or very low for 77/127 comparisons.Moderate-quality evidence showed a beneficial effect of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), mental practice, mirror therapy, interventions for sensory impairment, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice, suggesting that these may be effective interventions; moderate-quality evidence also indicated that unilateral arm training may be more effective than bilateral arm training. Information was insufficient to reveal the relative effectiveness of different interventions.Moderate-quality evidence from subgroup analyses comparing greater and lesser doses of mental practice, repetitive task training and virtual reality demonstrates a beneficial effect for the group given the greater dose, although not for the group given the smaller dose; however tests for subgroup differences do not suggest a statistically significant difference between these groups. Future research related to dose is essential.Specific recommendations for future research are derived from current evidence. These recommendations include but are not limited to adequately powered, high-quality RCTs to confirm the benefit of CIMT, mental practice, mirror therapy, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice; high-quality RCTs to explore the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), tDCS, hands-on therapy, music therapy, pharmacological interventions and interventions for sensory impairment; and up-to-date reviews related to biofeedback, Bobath therapy, electrical stimulation, reach-to-grasp exercise, repetitive task training, strength training and stretching and positioning.\nAuthors' conclusions: Large numbers of overlapping reviews related to interventions to improve upper limb function following stroke have been identified, and this overview serves to signpost clinicians and policy makers toward relevant systematic reviews to support clinical decisions, providing one accessible, comprehensive document, which should support clinicians and policy makers in clinical decision making for stroke rehabilitation.Currently, no high-quality evidence can be found for any interventions that are currently used as part of routine practice, and evidence is insufficient to enable comparison of the relative effectiveness of interventions. Effective collaboration is urgently needed to support large, robust RCTs of interventions currently used routinely within clinical practice. Evidence related to dose of interventions is particularly needed, as this information has widespread clinical and research implications."

    "title": "Differences in myoelectric and body-powered upper-limb prostheses: Systematic literature review",
    "abstract": "The choice of a myoelectric or body-powered upper-limb prosthesis can be determined using factors including control, function, feedback, cosmesis, and rejection. Although body-powered and myoelectric control strategies offer unique functions, many prosthesis users must choose one. A systematic review was conducted to determine differences between myoelectric and body-powered prostheses to inform evidence-based clinical practice regarding prescription of these devices and training of users. A search of 9 databases identified 462 unique publications. Ultimately, 31 of them were included and 11 empirical evidence statements were developed. Conflicting evidence has been found in terms of the relative functional performance of body-powered and myoelectric prostheses. Body-powered prostheses have been shown to have advantages in durability, training time, frequency of adjustment, maintenance, and feedback; however, they could still benefit from improvements of control. Myoelectric prostheses have been shown to improve cosmesis and phantom-limb pain and are more accepted for light=intensity work. Currently, evidence is insufficient to conclude that either system provides a significant general advantage. Prosthetic selection should be based on a patient's individual needs and include personal preferences, prosthetic experience, and functional needs. This work demonstrates that there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding functional differences in upper-limb prostheses."

    "title": "Rehabilitation methods for reducing shoulder subluxation in post-stroke hemiparesis: a systematic review",
    "abstract": "Background Shoulder subluxation is a common post-stroke complication affecting up to 80% of the stroke subjects. The pathomechanics at the skeletal level does not provide the structural base for the neural-motor recovery. The management of subluxed shoulder has always been a challenge, complicating the motor and functional recovery. Objective To review the available studies of rehabilitation interventions for reduction of subluxed shoulder and to explore the evidence for impact of subluxation on motor recovery. Method PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, DORIS, PEDro, and OTseeker databases were searched using the keywords: Stroke and Shoulder and Subluxation. The experimental, quasi-experimental, and single group studies investigated the rehabilitation methods to reduce the subluxation were selected. A narrative synthesis of the findings from the selected studies was carried out. Result 2717 studies were identified and 22 studies (14 RCTs or controlled trials and 8 pre-post-single group studies) were finally selected for the review. The rehabilitation intervention: Functional electrical stimulation (FES)/electrical stimulation (11), orthosis/support (07), taping (02), and robotic training and other methods (02) were reviewed. FES is effective in reducing subluxation in acute stage. Shoulder support or orthosis while in situ may reduce the subluxation temporarily. X-ray was the most commonly used assessment tool for the subluxation. Implication of the rehabilitation technique on motor recovery has not been investigated. Conclusion No technique could effectively reduce the subluxation and facilitate the upper limb recovery. Further studies integrating the usual motor training and the subluxation rehabilitation are warranted. Future trials using more precise and valid tool such as ultrasonography are also needed."

    "title": "Exoskeleton and End-Effector Robots for Upper and Lower Limbs Rehabilitation: Narrative Review",
    "abstract": "Recovery of upper and lower limbs function is essential to reach independence in daily activities in patients with upper motor neuron syndrome (UMNS). Rehabilitation can provide a guide for motor recovery influencing the neurobiology of neuronal plasticity providing controlled, repetitive, and variable patterns. Increasing therapy dosage, intensity, number of repetition, execution of task-oriented exercises, and combining top-down and bottom-up approaches can promote plasticity and functional recovery. Robotic exoskeletons for upper and lower limbs, based on the principle of motor learning, have been introduced in neurorehabilitation. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of literature published on exoskeleton devices for upper and lower limb rehabilitation in patients with UMNS; we summarized the available current research evidence and outlined the new challenges that neurorehabilitation and bioengineering will have to face in the upcoming years. Robotic treatment should be considered a rehabilitation tool useful to generate a more complex, controlled multisensory stimulation of the patient and useful to modify the plasticity of neural connections through the experience of movement. Efficacy and efficiency of robotic treatment should be defined starting from intensity, complexity, and specificity of the robotic exercise, that are related to human-robot interaction in terms of motion, emotion, motivation, meaning of the task, feedback from the exoskeleton, and fine motion assistance. Duration of a single session, global period of the treatment, and the timing for beginning of robotic treatment are still open questions. There is the need to evaluate and individualize the treatment according to patient's characteristics. Robotic devices for upper and lower limbs open a window to define therapeutic modalities as possible beneficial drug, able to boost biological, neurobiological, and epigenetic changes in central nervous system. We need to implement large and innovative research programs to answer these issues in the near future."

    "title": "Intensive virtual reality and robotic based upper limb training compared to usual care, and associated cortical reorganization, in the acute and early sub-acute periods post-stroke: a feasibility study",
    "abstract": "Background: There is conflict regarding the benefits of greater amounts of intensive upper limb rehabilitation in the early period post-stroke. This study was conducted to test the feasibility of providing intensive therapy during the early period post-stroke and to develop a randomized control trial that is currently in process. Specifically, the study investigated whether an additional 8 h of specialized, intensive (200-300 separate hand or arm movements per hour) virtual reality (VR)/robotic based upper limb training introduced within 1-month post-stroke resulted in greater improvement in impairment and behavior, and distinct changes in cortical reorganization measured via Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), compared to that of a control group.\nMethods: Seven subjects received 8-1 h sessions of upper limb VR/robotic training in addition to their inpatient therapy (PT, OT, ST). Six subjects only received their inpatient therapy. All were tested on measures of impairment [Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UEFMA), Wrist AROM, Maximum Pinch Force], behavior [Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)], and also received TMS mapping until 6 months post training. ANOVAs were conducted to measure differences between groups across time for all outcome measures. Associations between changes in ipsilesional cortical maps during the early period of enhanced neuroplasticity and long-term changes in upper limb impairment and behavior measures were evaluated.\nResults: The VR/robotic group made significantly greater improvements on UEFMA and Wrist AROM scores compared to the usual care group. There was also less variability in the association between changes in the First Dorsal Interosseus (FDI) muscle map area and WMFT and Maximum Force change scores for the VR/robotic group.\nConclusions: An additional 8 h of intensive VR/robotic based upper limb training initiated within the first month post-stroke may promote greater gains in impairment compared to usual care alone. Importantly, the data presented demonstrated the feasibility of conducting this intervention and multiple outcome measures (impairment, behavioral, neurophysiological) in the early period post-stroke."

    "title": "Learning of Artificial Sensation Through Long-Term Home Use of a Sensory-Enabled Prosthesis",
    "abstract": "Upper limb prostheses are specialized tools, and skilled operation is learned by amputees over time. Recently, neural prostheses using implanted peripheral nerve interfaces have enabled advances in artificial somatosensory feedback that can improve prosthesis outcomes. However, the effect of sensory learning on artificial somatosensation has not been studied, despite its known influence on intact somatosensation and analogous neuroprostheses. Sensory learning involves changes in the perception and interpretation of sensory feedback and may further influence functional and psychosocial outcomes. In this mixed methods case study, we examined how passive learning over 115 days of home use of a neural-connected, sensory-enabled prosthetic hand influenced perception of artificial sensory feedback in a participant with transradial amputation. We examined perceptual changes both within individual days of use and across the duration of the study. At both time scales, the reported percept locations became significantly more aligned with prosthesis sensor locations, and the phantom limb became significantly more extended toward the prosthesis position. Similarly, the participant's ratings of intensity, naturalness, and contact touch significantly increased, while his ratings of vibration and movement significantly decreased across-days for tactile channels. These sensory changes likely resulted from engagement of cortical plasticity mechanisms as the participant learned to use the artificial sensory feedback. We also assessed psychosocial and functional outcomes through surveys and interviews, and found that self-efficacy, perceived function, prosthesis embodiment, social touch, body image, and prosthesis efficiency improved significantly. These outcomes typically improved within the first month of home use, demonstrating rapid benefits of artificial sensation. Participant interviews indicated that the naturalness of the experience and engagement with the prosthesis increased throughout the study, suggesting that artificial somatosensation may decrease prosthesis abandonment. Our data showed that prosthesis embodiment was intricately related to naturalness and phantom limb perception, and that learning the artificial sensation may have modified the body schema. As another indicator of successfully learning to use artificial sensation, the participant reported the emergence of stereognosis later in the study. This study provides the first evidence that artificial somatosensation can undergo similar learning processes as intact sensation and highlights the importance of sensory restoration in prostheses."

    "title": "Neurotechnology-aided interventions for upper limb motor rehabilitation in severe chronic stroke",
    "abstract": "Upper limb motor deficits in severe stroke survivors often remain unresolved over extended time periods. Novel neurotechnologies have the potential to significantly support upper limb motor restoration in severely impaired stroke individuals. Here, we review recent controlled clinical studies and reviews focusing on the mechanisms of action and effectiveness of single and combined technology-aided interventions for upper limb motor rehabilitation after stroke, including robotics, muscular electrical stimulation, brain stimulation and brain computer/machine interfaces. We aim at identifying possible guidance for the optimal use of these new technologies to enhance upper limb motor recovery especially in severe chronic stroke patients. We found that the current literature does not provide enough evidence to support strict guidelines, because of the variability of the procedures for each intervention and of the heterogeneity of the stroke population. The present results confirm that neurotechnology-aided upper limb rehabilitation is promising for severe chronic stroke patients, but the combination of interventions often lacks understanding of single intervention mechanisms of action, which may not reflect the summation of single intervention's effectiveness. Stroke rehabilitation is a long and complex process, and one single intervention administrated in a short time interval cannot have a large impact for motor recovery, especially in severely impaired patients. To design personalized interventions combining or proposing different interventions in sequence, it is necessary to have an excellent understanding of the mechanisms determining the effectiveness of a single treatment in this heterogeneous population of stroke patients. We encourage the identification of objective biomarkers for stroke recovery for patients' stratification and to tailor treatments. Furthermore, the advantage of longitudinal personalized trial designs compared to classical double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials as the basis for precise personalized stroke rehabilitation medicine is discussed. Finally, we also promote the necessary conceptual change from 'one-suits-all' treatments within in-patient clinical rehabilitation set-ups towards personalized home-based treatment strategies, by adopting novel technologies merging rehabilitation and motor assistance, including implantable ones."

    "title": "Upper limb robotics applied to neurorehabilitation: An overview of clinical practice",
    "abstract": "Background: During the last two decades, extensive interaction between clinicians and engineers has led to the development of systems that stimulate neural plasticity to optimize motor recovery after neurological lesions. This has resulted in the expansion of the field of robotics for rehabilitation. Studies in patients with stroke-related upper-limb paresis have shown that robotic rehabilitation can improve motor capacity. However, few other applications have been evaluated (e.g. tremor, peripheral nerve injuries or other neurological diseases).\nPurpose: This paper presents an overview of the current use of upper limb robotic systems for neurorehabilitation, and highlights the rationale behind their use for the assessment and treatment of common neurological disorders.\nConclusions: Rehabilitation robots are little integrated in clinical practice, except after stroke. Although few studies have been carried out to evaluate their effectiveness, evidence from the neurosciences and indications from pilot studies suggests that upper limb robotic rehabilitation can be applied safely in various other neurological conditions. Rehabilitation robots provide an intensity, quality and dose of treatment that exceeds therapist-mediated rehabilitation. Moreover, the use of force fields, multi-sensory environments, feedback etc. renders such rehabilitation engaging and motivating. Future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation robots in neurological pathologies other than stroke."

    "title": "A review of invasive and non-invasive sensory feedback in upper limb prostheses",
    "abstract": "The constant challenge to restore sensory feedback in prosthetic hands has provided several research solutions, but virtually none has reached clinical fruition. A prosthetic hand with sensory feedback that closely imitates an intact hand and provides a natural feeling may induce the prosthetic hand to be included in the body image and also reinforces the control of the prosthesis. Areas covered: This review presents non-invasive sensory feedback systems such as mechanotactile, vibrotactile, electrotactile and combinational systems which combine the modalities; multi-haptic feedback. Invasive sensory feedback has been tried less, because of the inherent risk, but it has successfully shown to restore some afferent channels. In this review, invasive methods are also discussed, both extraneural and intraneural electrodes, such as cuff electrodes and transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes. The focus of the review is on non-invasive methods of providing sensory feedback to upper-limb amputees. Expert commentary: Invoking embodiment has shown to be of importance for the control of prosthesis and acceptance by the prosthetic wearers. It is a challenge to provide conscious feedback to cover the lost sensibility of a hand, not be overwhelming and confusing for the user, and to integrate technology within the constraint of a wearable prosthesis."

    "title": "Brain-Machine Interfaces: From Basic Science to Neuroprostheses and Neurorehabilitation",
    "abstract": "Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) combine methods, approaches, and concepts derived from neurophysiology, computer science, and engineering in an effort to establish real-time bidirectional links between living brains and artificial actuators. Although theoretical propositions and some proof of concept experiments on directly linking the brains with machines date back to the early 1960s, BMI research only took off in earnest at the end of the 1990s, when this approach became intimately linked to new neurophysiological methods for sampling large-scale brain activity. The classic goals of BMIs are 1) to unveil and utilize principles of operation and plastic properties of the distributed and dynamic circuits of the brain and 2) to create new therapies to restore mobility and sensations to severely disabled patients. Over the past decade, a wide range of BMI applications have emerged, which considerably expanded these original goals. BMI studies have shown neural control over the movements of robotic and virtual actuators that enact both upper and lower limb functions. Furthermore, BMIs have also incorporated ways to deliver sensory feedback, generated from external actuators, back to the brain. BMI research has been at the forefront of many neurophysiological discoveries, including the demonstration that, through continuous use, artificial tools can be assimilated by the primate brain's body schema. Work on BMIs has also led to the introduction of novel neurorehabilitation strategies. As a result of these efforts, long-term continuous BMI use has been recently implicated with the induction of partial neurological recovery in spinal cord injury patients."

    "title": "Restoring Motor Functions After Stroke: Multiple Approaches and Opportunities",
    "abstract": "More than 1.5 million people suffer a stroke in Europe per year and more than 70% of stroke survivors experience limited functional recovery of their upper limb, resulting in diminished quality of life. Therefore, interventions to address upper-limb impairment are a priority for stroke survivors and clinicians. While a significant body of evidence supports the use of conventional treatments, such as intensive motor training or constraint-induced movement therapy, the limited and heterogeneous improvements they allow are, for most patients, usually not sufficient to return to full autonomy. Various innovative neurorehabilitation strategies are emerging in order to enhance beneficial plasticity and improve motor recovery. Among them, robotic technologies, brain-computer interfaces, or noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are showing encouraging results. These innovative interventions, such as NIBS, will only provide maximized effects, if the field moves away from the \"one-fits all\" approach toward a \"patient-tailored\" approach. After summarizing the most commonly used rehabilitation approaches, we will focus on NIBS and highlight the factors that limit its widespread use in clinical settings. Subsequently, we will propose potential biomarkers that might help to stratify stroke patients in order to identify the individualized optimal therapy. We will discuss future methodological developments, which could open new avenues for poststroke rehabilitation, toward more patient-tailored precision medicine approaches and pathophysiologically motivated strategies."

    "title": "Upper limb cortical maps in amputees with targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation",
    "abstract": "Neuroprosthetics research in amputee patients aims at developing new prostheses that move and feel like real limbs. Targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) is such an approach and consists of rerouting motor and sensory nerves from the residual limb towards intact muscles and skin regions. Movement of the myoelectric prosthesis is enabled via decoded electromyography activity from reinnervated muscles and touch sensation on the missing limb is enabled by stimulation of the reinnervated skin areas. Here we ask whether and how motor control and redirected somatosensory stimulation provided via TMSR affected the maps of the upper limb in primary motor (M1) and primary somatosensory (S1) cortex, as well as their functional connections. To this aim, we tested three TMSR patients and investigated the extent, strength, and topographical organization of the missing limb and several control body regions in M1 and S1 at ultra high-field (7 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, we analysed the functional connectivity between M1 and S1 and of both these regions with fronto-parietal regions, known to be important for multisensory upper limb processing. These data were compared with those of control amputee patients (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 12). We found that M1 maps of the amputated limb in TMSR patients were similar in terms of extent, strength, and topography to healthy controls and different from non-TMSR patients. S1 maps of TMSR patients were also more similar to normal conditions in terms of topographical organization and extent, as compared to non-targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation patients, but weaker in activation strength compared to healthy controls. Functional connectivity in TMSR patients between upper limb maps in M1 and S1 was comparable with healthy controls, while being reduced in non-TMSR patients. However, connectivity was reduced between S1 and fronto-parietal regions, in both the TMSR and non-TMSR patients with respect to healthy controls. This was associated with the absence of a well-established multisensory effect (visual enhancement of touch) in TMSR patients. Collectively, these results show how M1 and S1 process signals related to movement and touch are enabled by targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation. Moreover, they suggest that TMSR may counteract maladaptive cortical plasticity typically found after limb loss, in M1, partially in S1, and in their mutual connectivity. The lack of multisensory interaction in the present data suggests that further engineering advances are necessary (e.g. the integration of somatosensory feedback into current prostheses) to enable prostheses that move and feel as real limbs."

    "title": "Feasibility of an Electromyography-Triggered Hand Robot for People After Chronic Stroke",
    "abstract": "Importance: Effective treatment of the affected hand after stroke is crucial for improved functional independence and recovery.\nObjective: To determine the feasibility and clinical utility of an electromyography-triggered hand robot.\nDesign: Single-group repeated-measures design. Participants completed training 3×/wk for 6 wk. Feasibility data included participant feedback, adverse events, and compliance rates. Upper extremity outcomes were collected at baseline, discharge, and 6-wk follow-up.\nSetting: Outpatient clinic.\nParticipants: Twelve stroke survivors at least 6 mo poststroke living in the community.\nIntervention: Eighteen sessions of intensive robotic hand therapy over 6 wk. Each 60-min treatment session was personalized to match the participant's ability.\nOutcomes and measures: Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT), Stroke Impact Scale Hand subscale (SIS-H), Stroke Upper Limb Capacity Scale (SULCS), Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Box and Block Test, and dynamometer.\nResults: All participants completed the training phase. Mild skin pinching or rubbing at dorsal proximal interphalangeal joint and proximal arm fatigue were the most common adverse events. Improvements in raw scores were achieved from baseline to discharge for all outcome measures, except the SULCS. Participants significantly improved from baseline to discharge on the AMAT and the SIS-H, and improvements were maintained at 6-wk follow-up.\nConclusion and relevance: Robotic hand training was feasible, safe, and well tolerated. Participants reported and demonstrated improvements in functional use of the affected arm. Thirty percent of participants achieved clinically significant improvements on the AMAT. We recommend further study of the device in a larger study using the AMAT as a primary outcome measure.\nWhat this article adds: It is feasible and safe to implement a robotic hand training protocol for people with moderate to severe arm impairment in an outpatient setting. Robotic training may provide a viable option for this group to actively participate in intensive training of the distal hand."

    "title": "Restoration of motor control and proprioceptive and cutaneous sensation in humans with prior upper-limb amputation via multiple Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (USEAs) implanted in residual peripheral arm nerves",
    "abstract": "Background: Despite advances in sophisticated robotic hands, intuitive control of and sensory feedback from these prostheses has been limited to only 3-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) with 2 sensory percepts in closed-loop control. A Utah Slanted Electrode Array (USEA) has been used in the past to provide up to 81 sensory percepts for human amputees. Here, we report on the advanced capabilities of multiple USEAs implanted in the residual peripheral arm nerves of human amputees for restoring control of 5 DOF and sensation of up to 131 proprioceptive and cutaneous hand sensory percepts. We also demonstrate that USEA-restored sensory percepts provide a useful source of feedback during closed-loop virtual prosthetic hand control.\nMethods: Two 100-channel USEAs were implanted for 4-5 weeks, one each in the median and ulnar arm nerves of two human subjects with prior long-duration upper-arm amputations. Intended finger and wrist positions were decoded from neuronal firing patterns via a modified Kalman filter, allowing subjects to control many movements of a virtual prosthetic hand. Additionally, USEA microstimulation was used to evoke numerous sensory percepts spanning the phantom hand. Closed-loop control was achieved by stimulating via an electrode of the ulnar-nerve USEA while recording and decoding movement via the median-nerve USEA.\nResults: Subjects controlled up to 12 degrees-of-freedom during informal, 'freeform' online movement decode sessions, and experienced up to 131 USEA-evoked proprioceptive and cutaneous sensations spanning the phantom hand. Independent control was achieved for a 5-DOF real-time decode that included flexion/extension of the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers, and the wrist. Proportional control was achieved for a 4-DOF real-time decode. One subject used a USEA-evoked hand sensation as feedback to complete a 1-DOF closed-loop virtual-hand movement task. There were no observed long-term functional deficits due to the USEA implants.\nConclusions: Implantation of high-channel-count USEAs enables multi-degree-of-freedom control of virtual prosthetic hand movement and restoration of a rich selection of both proprioceptive and cutaneous sensory percepts spanning the hand during the short 4-5 week post-implant period. Future USEA use in longer-term implants and in closed-loop may enable restoration of many of the capabilities of an intact hand while contributing to a meaningful embodiment of the prosthesis."

    "title": "High-performance neuroprosthetic control by an individual with tetraplegia",
    "abstract": "Background: Paralysis or amputation of an arm results in the loss of the ability to orient the hand and grasp, manipulate, and carry objects, functions that are essential for activities of daily living. Brain-machine interfaces could provide a solution to restoring many of these lost functions. We therefore tested whether an individual with tetraplegia could rapidly achieve neurological control of a high-performance prosthetic limb using this type of an interface.\nMethods: We implanted two 96-channel intracortical microelectrodes in the motor cortex of a 52-year-old individual with tetraplegia. Brain-machine-interface training was done for 13 weeks with the goal of controlling an anthropomorphic prosthetic limb with seven degrees of freedom (three-dimensional translation, three-dimensional orientation, one-dimensional grasping). The participant's ability to control the prosthetic limb was assessed with clinical measures of upper limb function. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01364480.\nFindings: The participant was able to move the prosthetic limb freely in the three-dimensional workspace on the second day of training. After 13 weeks, robust seven-dimensional movements were performed routinely. Mean success rate on target-based reaching tasks was 91·6% (SD 4·4) versus median chance level 6·2% (95% CI 2·0-15·3). Improvements were seen in completion time (decreased from a mean of 148 s [SD 60] to 112 s [6]) and path efficiency (increased from 0·30 [0·04] to 0·38 [0·02]). The participant was also able to use the prosthetic limb to do skilful and coordinated reach and grasp movements that resulted in clinically significant gains in tests of upper limb function. No adverse events were reported.\nInterpretation: With continued development of neuroprosthetic limbs, individuals with long-term paralysis could recover the natural and intuitive command signals for hand placement, orientation, and reaching, allowing them to perform activities of daily living.\nFunding: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, National Institutes of Health, Department of Veterans Affairs, and UPMC Rehabilitation Institute."

    "abstract": "Mental practice (MP) is usually provided in combination with other therapies, and new developments for neurofeedback to support MP have been made recently. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of MP and to investigate the intervention characteristics including neurofeedback that may affect treatment outcome. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, KoreaMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PEDro, and CIRRIE were searched from inception to March 2017 for randomized controlled trials to assess the effect of MP for upper limb rehabilitation after stroke. Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) was used as the outcome measure for meta-analysis. Twenty-five trials met the inclusion criteria, and 15 trials were eligible for meta-analysis. Among the trials selected for meta-analysis, MP was added to conventional therapy in eight trials or to modified constraint-induced movement therapy in one trial. The other trials provided neurofeedback to support MP: MP-guided neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in four trials and MP-guided robot-assisted therapy (RAT) in two trials. MP added to conventional therapy resulted in significantly higher FMA gain than conventional therapy alone. MP-guided NMES showed superior result than conventional NMES as well. However, the FMA gain of MP-guided RAT was not significantly higher than RAT alone. We suggest that MP is an effective complementary therapy either given with neurofeedback or not. Neurofeedback applied to MP showed different results depending on the therapy provided. This study has limitations because of heterogeneity and inadequate quality of trials. Further research is requested."

    "title": "Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation Combined with Robotic Rehabilitation Improves Upper Limb Function after Stroke",
    "abstract": "The efficacy of standard rehabilitative therapy for improving upper limb functions after stroke is limited; thus, alternative strategies are needed. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with rehabilitation is a promising approach, but the invasiveness of this technique limits its clinical application. Recently, a noninvasive method to stimulate vagus nerve has been developed. The aim of the present study was to explore whether noninvasive VNS combined with robotic rehabilitation can enhance upper limb functionality in chronic stroke. Safety and efficacy of this combination have been assessed within a proof-of-principle, double-blind, semirandomized, sham-controlled trial. Fourteen patients with either ischemic or haemorrhagic chronic stroke were randomized to robot-assisted therapy associated with real or sham VNS, delivered for 10 working days. Efficacy was evaluated by change in upper extremity Fugl-Meyer score. After intervention, there were no adverse events and Fugl-Meyer scores were significantly better in the real group compared to the sham group. Our pilot study confirms that VNS is feasible in stroke patients and can produce a slight clinical improvement in association to robotic rehabilitation. Compared to traditional stimulation, noninvasive VNS seems to be safer and more tolerable. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of this innovative approach."

    "abstract": "Background: Intensive robot-assisted arm training in the chronic phase of stroke recovery can lead to clinical improvement. Combinatorial therapeutic approaches are sought to further optimize stroke recovery. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is one candidate to combine with robotic training, as transient increases in excitability and improvements in motor behavior have separately been reported.\nObjective: To determine whether tDCS, delivered prior to robotic training, could augment clinical improvement.\nMethods: We conducted a dual-site, randomized controlled trial in 82 chronic ischemic stroke patients (inclusion > 6 m post-injury, dominant hemisphere, first stroke; residual hemiparesis) who were split into two groups to receive tDCS (M1-SO montage, anode ipsilesional, 5×7 cm electrodes, 2 mA, 20 mins) or sham tDCS, prior to robotic upper-limb training (12 weeks; 36 sessions; shoulder-elbow robot or wrist robot on alternating sessions). The primary end-point was taken after 12 weeks of training, and assessed with the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer impairment scale (FM). Corticomotor conduction was assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).\nResults: For the combined group (n = 82; post-training) robotic training increased the FM by 7.36 points compared to baseline (p < 0.0001). There was no difference in the FM increase between the tDCS and sham groups (6.97 and 7.73 respectively, p = 0.46). In both groups, clinically meaningful improvement (≥5 points) from baseline was evident in the majority of patients (56/77), was sustained six months later (54/72), and could be attained in severe, moderate and mild baseline hemiparesis. Clinical improvement was associated with increased excitability in the affected hemisphere as assessed by resting motor threshold (pre-post p = 0.029; pre-post 6 months p = 0.029), but not with threshold-adjusted assessment of MEP amplitude (pre-post p = 0.09; pre-post 6 months p = 0.15). Participants with motor evoked potentials were more likely to improve clinically than those without (17/18, 94%, versus 39/59, 66%, p = 0.018).\nConclusions: Our study confirms the benefit of intensive robot-assisted training in stroke recovery, and indicates that conventional tDCS does not confer further advantage to robotic training. We also showed that corticospinal integrity, as assessed by TMS, is a predictor of clinically meaningful response to intensive arm therapy in chronic stroke."

    "title": "An Orthopaedic Robotic-Assisted Rehabilitation Method of the Forearm in Virtual Reality Physiotherapy",
    "abstract": "The use of robotic rehabilitation in orthopaedics has been briefly explored. Despite its possible advantages, the use of computer-assisted physiotherapy of patients with musculoskeletal injuries has received little attention. In this paper, we detailed the development and evaluation of a robotic-assisted rehabilitation system as a new methodology of assisted physiotherapy in orthopaedics. The proposal consists of an enhanced end-effector haptic interface mounted in a passive mechanism for allowing patients to perform upper-limb exercising and integrates virtual reality games conceived explicitly for assisting the treatment of the forearm after injuries at the wrist or elbow joints. The present methodology represents a new approach to assisted physiotherapy for strength and motion recovery of wrist pronation/supination and elbow flexion-extension movements. We design specific game scenarios enriched by proprioceptive and haptic force feedback in three training modes: passive, active, and assisted exercising. The system allows the therapist to tailor the difficulty level on the observed motion capacity of the patients and the kinesiology measurements provided by the system itself. We evaluated the system through the analysis of the muscular activity of two healthy subjects, showing that the system can assign significant working loads during typical physiotherapy treatment profiles. Subsequently, a group of ten patients undergoing manual orthopaedic rehabilitation of the forearm tested the system, under similar conditions at variable intensities. Patients tolerated changes in difficulty through the tests, and they expressed a favourable opinion of the system through the administered questionnaires, which indicates that the system was well accepted and that the proposed methodology was feasible for the case study for subsequently controlled trials. Finally, a predictive model of the performance score in the form of a linear combination of kinesiology observations was implemented in function of difficult training parameters, as a way of systematically individualising the training during the therapy, for subsequent studies."

    "title": "Evolution of Neuroprosthetic Approaches to Restoration of Upper Extremity Function in Spinal Cord Injury",
    "abstract": "Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) occurring at the cervical levels can result in significantly impaired arm and hand function. People with cervical-level SCI desire improved use of their arms and hands, anticipating that regained function will result in improved independence and ultimately improved quality of life. Neuroprostheses provide the most promising method for significant gain in hand and arm function for persons with cervical-level SCI. Neuroprostheses utilize small electrical currents to activate peripheral motor nerves, resulting in controlled contraction of paralyzed muscles. Methods: A myoelectrically-controlled neuroprosthesis was evaluated in 15 arms in 13 individuals with cervical-level SCI. All individuals had motor level C5 or C6 tetraplegia. Results: This study demonstrates that an implanted neuroprosthesis utilizing myoelectric signal (MES)-controlled stimulation allows considerable flexibility in the control algorithms that can be utilized for a variety of arm and hand functions. Improved active range of motion, grip strength, and the ability to pick up and release objects were improved in all arms tested. Adverse events were few and were consistent with the experience with similar active implantable devices. Conclusion: For individuals with cervical SCI who are highly motivated, implanted neuroprostheses provide the opportunity to gain arm and hand function that cannot be gained through the use of orthotics or surgical intervention alone. Upper extremity neuroprostheses have been shown to provide increased function and independence for persons with cervical-level SCI."

    "title": "Upbeat: Augmented Reality-Guided Dancing for Prosthetic Rehabilitation of Upper Limb Amputees",
    "abstract": "Unsuccessful rehabilitation therapy is a widespread issue amongst modern day amputees. Of the estimated 10 million amputees worldwide, 3 million of whom are upper limb amputees, a large majority are discontent and experience rejection with their current prosthesis during activities of daily living (ADL). Here we introduce Upbeat, an augmented reality (AR) dance game designed to improve rehabilitation therapies in upper limb amputees. In Upbeat, the patient is instructed to follow a virtual dance instructor, performing choreographed dance movements containing hand gestures involved in upper limb rehabilitation therapy. The patient's position is then tracked using a Microsoft Kinect sensor while the hand gestures are analyzed using EMG data collected from a Myo Armband. Additionally, a gamified score is calculated based on how many gestures and movements were correctly performed. Upon completion of the game, a diagnostic summary of the results is shown in the form of a graph summarizing the collected EMG data, as well as with a video displaying an augmented visualization of the patient's upper arm muscle activity during gameplay. By gamifying the rehabilitation process, Upbeat has the potential to improve therapy on upper limb amputees by enabling the start of rehabilitation immediately after trauma, providing personalized feedback which professionals can utilize to accurately assess patient's progress, and increasing patient excitement, therefore increasing patient willingness to complete rehabilitation. This paper is concerned with the description and evaluation of our prototypic implementation of Upbeat that will serve as the basis for conducting clinical studies to evaluate its impact on rehabilitation."

    "title": "Motor learning with the PNF-concept, an alternative to constrained induced movement therapy in a patient after a stroke; a case report",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Over sixteen million people suffer a stroke each year. Stroke is characterized by a one-sided paresis. Upper extremity and hand function are most limited. The current view on \"neuro rehabilitation\" advocates a constrained induced movement therapy (CIMT) setting. This case report seeks to illustrate the clinical reasoning and the feasibility of applying an alternative approach in patients who are not accepted or not suitable for the constrained induced movement therapy.\nCase description: A male patient, 68 years of age, developed impairments in his right arm and hand, such as loss of range of motion and strength besides spasticity after a stroke. This resulted in a loss of dexterity in his affected right side and in \"disuse\" of that arm and hand.\nPatient management: A therapy was designed based upon the Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation-concept (PNF-concept) and consisting of PNF pattern exercises in a functional task setting with specified PNF-principles of facilitations and PNF-techniques for motor re-learning activities, over a period of six weeks. This resulted in clinical important improvements of wrist extension, grip strength, spasticity, dexterity and patient satisfaction with specific tasks.\nDiscussion and conclusion: The provided comprehensive therapy mimics CIMT and robotics. The approach addresses possibly motor learning effects, cortical reorganization and structural impairments. Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) - diagonal movement patterns have been described as: \"having beneficial effects in cortical adaptations and cortical organization resulting in motor learning effects\". In cases where CIMT is difficult to apply, a specified PNF-based therapy has shown to be a feasible alternative."

    "abstract": "The impact of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is controversial in the neurorehabilitation literature. It has been suggested that tDCS should be combined with other therapy to improve their efficacy. To assess the effectiveness of a single session of upper limb robotic-assisted therapy (RAT) combined with real or sham-tDCS in chronic stroke patients. Twenty-one hemiparetic chronic stroke patients were included in a randomized, controlled, cross-over double-blind study. Each patient underwent two sessions 7 days apart in a randomized order: (a) 20 min of real dual-tDCS associated with RAT (REAL+RAT) and (b) 20 min of sham dual-tDCS associated with RAT (SHAM+RAT). Patient dexterity (Box and Block and Purdue Pegboard tests) and upper limb kinematics were evaluated before and just after each intervention. The assistance provided by the robot during the intervention was also recorded. Gross manual dexterity (1.8±0.7 blocks, P=0.008) and straightness of movement (0.01±0.03, P<0.05) improved slightly after REAL+RAT compared with before the intervention. There was no improvement after SHAM+RAT. The post-hoc analyses did not indicate any difference between interventions: REAL+RAT and SHAM+RAT (P>0.05). The assistance provided by the robot was similar during both interventions (P>0.05). The results showed a slight improvement in hand dexterity and arm movement after the REAL+RAT tDCS intervention. The observed effect after a single session was small and not clinically relevant. Repetitive sessions could increase the benefits of this combined approach."

    "title": "Early intervention to improve hand function in hemiplegic cerebral palsy",
    "abstract": "Children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy often have marked hand involvement with excessive thumb adduction and flexion and limited active wrist extension from infancy. Post-lesional aberrant plasticity can lead to progressive abnormalities of the developing motor system. Disturbances of somatosensory and visual function and developmental disregard contribute to difficulties with hand use. Progressive soft tissue and bony changes may occur, leading to contractures, which further limit function in a vicious cycle. Early intervention might help to break this cycle, however, the precise nature and appropriateness of the intervention must be carefully considered. Traditional approaches to the hemiplegic upper limb include medications and botulinum toxin injections to manage abnormalities of tone, and surgical interventions. Therapist input, including provision of orthoses, remains a mainstay although many therapies have not been well evaluated. There has been a recent increase in interventions for the hemiplegic upper limb, mostly aimed outside the period of infancy. These include trials of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and bimanual therapy as well as the use of virtual reality and robot-assisted therapy. In future, non-invasive brain stimulation may be combined with therapy. Interventions under investigation in the infant age group include modified CIMT and action observation therapy. A further approach which may be suited to the infant with thumb-in-palm deformity, but which requires evaluation, is the use of elastic taping. Enhanced cutaneous feedback through mechanical stimulation to the skin provided by the tape during movement has been postulated to modulate ongoing muscle activity. If effective, this would represent a low-cost, safe, widely applicable early intervention."

    "title": "Adding vibrotactile feedback to a myoelectric-controlled hand improves performance when online visual feedback is disturbed",
    "abstract": "We investigated whether adding vibrotactile feedback to a myoelectric-controlled hand, when visual feedback is disturbed, can improve performance during a functional test. For this purpose, able-bodied subjects, activating a myoelectric-controlled hand attached to their right hand performed the modified Box & Blocks test, grasping and manipulating wooden blocks over a partition. This was performed in 3 conditions, using a repeated-measures design: in full light, in a dark room where visual feedback was disturbed and no auditory feedback - one time with the addition of tactile feedback provided during object grasping and manipulation, and one time without any tactile feedback. The average time needed to transfer one block was measured, and an infrared camera was used to give information on the number of grasping errors during performance of the test. Our results show that when vibrotactile feedback was provided, performance time was reduced significantly, compared with when no vibrotactile feedback was available. Furthermore, the accuracy of grasping and manipulation was improved, reflected by significantly fewer errors during test performance. In conclusion, adding vibrotactile feedback to a myoelectric-controlled hand has positive effects on functional performance when visual feedback is disturbed. This may have applications to current myoelectric-controlled hands, as adding tactile feedback may help prosthesis users to improve their functional ability during daily life activities in different environments, particularly when limited visual feedback is available or desirable."

    "title": "Self-directed therapy programmes for arm rehabilitation after stroke: a systematic review",
    "abstract": "Aim: To investigate the effectiveness of self-directed arm interventions in adult stroke survivors.\nMethods: A systematic review of Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS and IEEE Xplore up to February 2018 was carried out. Studies of stroke arm interventions were included where more than 50% of the time spent in therapy was initiated and carried out by the participant. Quality of the evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.\nResults: A total of 40 studies ( n = 1172 participants) were included (19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 21 before-after studies). Studies were grouped according to no technology or the main additional technology used (no technology n = 5; interactive gaming n = 6; electrical stimulation n = 11; constraint-induced movement therapy n = 6; robotic and dynamic orthotic devices n = 8; mirror therapy n = 1; telerehabilitation n = 2; wearable devices n = 1). A beneficial effect on arm function was found for self-directed interventions using constraint-induced movement therapy ( n = 105; standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.00 to 0.78) and electrical stimulation ( n = 94; SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.08-0.91). Constraint-induced movement therapy and therapy programmes without technology improved independence in activities of daily living. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated arm function benefit for patients >12 months poststroke ( n = 145; SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.21-0.82) but not at 0-3, 3-6 or 6-12 months.\nConclusion: Self-directed interventions can enhance arm recovery after stroke but the effect varies according to the approach used and timing. There were benefits identified from self-directed delivery of constraint-induced movement therapy, electrical stimulation and therapy programmes that increase practice without using additional technology."

[Subjects and Methods] Participants were 21 chronic stroke survivors (19 men; 60.8 years; Mini-Mental State Examination score: 28; onset duration: 10.2 years). Training exercises were performed with a Whole Arm Manipulator and a 120-inch projective display to provide visual and auditory feedback. Once the training began, red and grey balls appeared on the projective display, and participants performed reaching movements, in the assist-as-needed mode, toward 6 directional targets in a 3-dimensional space. All participants received training for 40 minutes per day, thrice per week, for 6 weeks. Main outcome measures were upper limb function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Action Research Arm Test, and Box and Blocks Test scores), activities of daily living performance (Modified Barthel Index), and kinematic performance (movement velocity) in 6 directions. [Results] After 6 weeks, significant improvement was observed in upper limb function, activities of daily living performance, and kinematic performance.

The selected studies were randomized controlled trials involving brain-computer interface interventions in stroke patients, with upper limb assessment as primary outcome measures. Reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the trials, using the PEDro methodologic rating scale.\nResults: From 309 titles, we included nine studies with high quality (PEDro ≥ 6). We found that the most common interface used was non-invasive electroencephalography, and the main neurofeedback, in stroke rehabilitation, was usually visual abstract or a combination with the control of an orthosis/robotic limb. Moreover, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale was a major outcome measure in eight out of nine studies. In addition, the benefits of functional electric stimulation associated to an interface were found in three studies.\nConclusions: Neurofeedback training with brain-computer interface systems seem to promote clinical and neurophysiologic changes in stroke patients, in particular those with long-term efficacy."

    "abstract": "Background: Vibrotactile stimulation is a promising venue in the field of prosthetics to retrain sensory feedback deficits following amputation. Discrimination is well established at the forearm level but not at the upper arm level. Moreover, the effects of combining vibration characteristics such as duration and intensity has never been investigated.\nMethod: We conducted experiments on spatial discrimination (experiment 1) and tactile intensity perception (experiment 2), using 9 combinations of 3 intensities and 3 durations of vibror stimulations device. Those combinations were tested under 4 arrangements with an array of 6 vibrors. In both experiments, linear orientation aligned with the upper arm longitudinal axis were compared to circular orientation on the upper arm circumference. For both orientations, vibrors were placed either with 3cm space between the center of 2 vibrors or proportionally to the length or the circumference of the subject upper arm. Eleven heathy subjects underwent the 2 experiments and 7 amputees (humeral level) participated in the spatial discrimination task with the best arrangement found.\nResults: Experiment 1 revealed that circular arrangements elicited better scores than the linear ones. Arrangements with vibrors spaced proportionally elicited better scores (up to 75% correct) than those with 3 cm spacing. Experiment 2, showed that the perceived intensity of the vibration increases with the intensity of the vibrors' activation, but also with their duration of activation. The 7 patients obtained high scores (up to 91.67% correct) with the circular proportional (CP) arrangement.\nDiscussion: These results highlight that discrete and short vibrations can be well discriminated by healthy subjects and people with an upper limb amputation. These new characteristics of vibrations have great potential for future sensory substitution application in closed-loop prosthetic control."

    "title": "Phantom motor execution as a treatment for phantom limb pain: protocol of an international, double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a chronic condition that can greatly diminish quality of life. Control over the phantom limb and exercise of such control have been hypothesised to reverse maladaptive brain changes correlated to PLP. Preliminary investigations have shown that decoding motor volition using myoelectric pattern recognition, while providing real-time feedback via virtual and augmented reality (VR-AR), facilitates phantom motor execution (PME) and reduces PLP. Here we present the study protocol for an international (seven countries), multicentre (nine clinics), double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of PME in alleviating PLP.\nMethods and analysis: Sixty-seven subjects suffering from PLP in upper or lower limbs are randomly assigned to PME or phantom motor imagery (PMI) interventions. Subjects allocated to either treatment receive 15 interventions and are exposed to the same VR-AR environments using the same device. The only difference between interventions is whether phantom movements are actually performed (PME) or just imagined (PMI). Complete evaluations are conducted at baseline and at intervention completion, as well as 1, 3 and 6 months later using an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. Changes in PLP measured using the Pain Rating Index between the first and last session are the primary measure of efficacy. Secondary outcomes include: frequency, duration, quality of pain, intrusion of pain in activities of daily living and sleep, disability associated to pain, pain self-efficacy, frequency of depressed mood, presence of catastrophising thinking, health-related quality of life and clinically significant change as patient's own impression. Follow-up interviews are conducted up to 6 months after the treatment.\nEthics and dissemination: The study is performed in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and under approval by the governing ethical committees of each participating clinic. The results will be published according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines in a peer-reviewed journal.\nTrial registration number: NCT03112928; Pre-results."

    "abstract": "Objective: Phantom limb pain is a condition frequently experienced after amputation. One treatment for phantom limb pain is traditional mirror therapy, yet some patients do not respond to this intervention, and immersive virtual reality mirror therapy offers some potential advantages. We report the case of a patient with severe phantom limb pain following an upper limb amputation and successful treatment with therapy in a custom virtual reality environment. Methods: An interactive 3-D kitchen environment was developed based on the principles of mirror therapy to allow for control of virtual hands while wearing a motion-tracked, head-mounted virtual reality display. The patient used myoelectric control of a virtual hand as well as motion-tracking control in this setting for five therapy sessions. Pain scale measurements and subjective feedback was elicited at each session. Results: Analysis of the measured pain scales showed statistically significant decreases per session [Visual Analog Scale, Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, and Wong-Baker FACES pain scores decreased by 55 percent (p=0.0143), 60 percent (p=0.023), and 90 percent (p=0.0024), respectively]. Significant subjective pain relief persisting between sessions was also reported, as well as marked immersion within the virtual environments. On followup at six weeks, the patient noted continued decrease in phantom limb pain symptoms. Conclusions: Currently available immersive virtual reality technology with myolectric and motion tracking control may represent a possible therapy option for treatment-resistant phantom limb pain."

    "abstract": "Background: Although the distal targets have been lost in proximal upper limb amputees, the neural signals for intuitive hand and arm function are still available and thus can be incorporated into more useful prosthetic function using targeted muscle reinnervation technique. In this article, the authors present their outcomes and range of indications in addition to experiences and pitfalls after 30 targeted muscle reinnervation cases at above-elbow and shoulder disarticulation level of amputation.\nMethods: Thirty patients with above-elbow or shoulder disarticulation amputations were enrolled between 2012 and 2017. Indications for targeted muscle reinnervation surgery differed between improvement of prosthetic function (n = 19) and/or pain (n = 11). Functional outcome was evaluated with the Action Research Arm Test, the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure, and the Clothespin-Relocation Test. Functional evaluation was performed at least at 6 months after final prosthetic fitting.\nResults: All nerve transfers were successful and provided independent myoelectric signals. The 10 patients available for final functional evaluation showed Action Research Arm Test scores of 20.4 ± 1.9 and Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure scores of 40.5 ± 8.1. The Clothespin-Relocation Test showed a mean time of 34.3 ± 14.4 seconds.\nConclusions: Targeted muscle reinnervation has improved prosthetic control and revolutionized neuroma treatment in upper limb amputees. Still, the rate of abandonment even after targeted muscle reinnervation surgery has been shown high, and several advances within the biotechnological interface will be needed to improve prosthetic function and acceptance in these patients.\nClinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV."

    "abstract": "The main goal of this study is to evaluate how to optimally select the best vibrotactile pattern to be used in a closed loop control of upper limb myoelectric prostheses as a feedback of the exerted force. To that end, we assessed both the selection of actuation patterns and the effects of the selection of frequency and amplitude parameters to discriminate between different feedback levels. A single vibrotactile actuator has been used to deliver the vibrations to subjects participating in the experiments. The results show no difference between pattern shapes in terms of feedback perception. Similarly, changes in amplitude level do not reflect significant improvement compared to changes in frequency. However, decreasing the number of feedback levels increases the accuracy of feedback perception and subject-specific variations are high for particular participants, showing that a fine-tuning of the parameters is necessary in a real-time application to upper limb prosthetics. In future works, the effects of training, location, and number of actuators will be assessed. This optimized selection will be tested in a real-time proportional myocontrol of a prosthetic hand."

Validation of the robotic mirror therapy system was performed to confirm its synchronicity prior to the clinical study. The mean error angle range between the intact arm and the robot was 1.97 to 4.59 degrees. A 56-year-old male who had right middle cerebral artery infarction 11 months ago received the robotic mirror therapy for ten 30-minute sessions during 2 weeks. Clinical evaluation and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies were performed before and after the intervention. At the follow-up evaluation, the thumb finding test score improved from 2 to 1 for eye level and from 3 to 1 for overhead level. The Albert's test score on the left side improved from 6 to 11. Improvements were sustained at 2-month follow-up. The fMRI during the passive motion revealed a considerable increase in brain activity at the lower part of the right superior parietal lobule, suggesting the possibility of proprioception enhancement. The robotic mirror therapy system may serve as a useful treatment method for patients with supratentorial stroke to facilitate recovery of proprioceptive deficit and hemineglect."

    "title": "Comparison of vibrotactile and joint-torque feedback in a myoelectric upper-limb prosthesis",
    "abstract": "Background: Despite the technological advancements in myoelectric prostheses, body-powered prostheses remain a popular choice for amputees, in part due to the natural sensory advantage they provide. Research on haptic feedback in myoelectric prostheses has delivered mixed results. Furthermore, there is limited research comparing various haptic feedback modalities in myoelectric prostheses. In this paper, we present a comparison of the feedback intrinsically present in body-powered prostheses (joint-torque feedback) to a commonly proposed feedback modality for myoelectric prostheses (vibrotactile feedback). In so doing, we seek to understand whether the advantages of kinesthetic feedback present in body-powered prostheses translate to myoelectric prostheses, and whether there are differences between kinesthetic and cutaneous feedback in prosthetic applications.\nMethods: We developed an experimental testbed that features a cable-driven, voluntary-closing 1-DoF prosthesis, a capstan-driven elbow exoskeleton, and a vibrotactile actuation unit. The system can present grip force to users as either a flexion moment about the elbow or vibration on the wrist. To provide an equal comparison of joint-torque and vibrotactile feedback, a stimulus intensity matching scheme was utilized. Non-amputee participants (n=12) were asked to discriminate objects of varying stiffness with the prosthesis in three conditions: no haptic feedback, vibrotactile feedback, and joint-torque feedback.\nResults: Results indicate that haptic feedback increased discrimination accuracy over no haptic feedback, but the difference between joint-torque feedback and vibrotactile feedback was not significant. In addition, our results highlight nuanced differences in performance depending on the objects' stiffness, and suggest that participants likely pay less attention to incidental cues with the addition of haptic feedback.\nConclusion: Even when haptic feedback is not modality matched to the task, such as in the case of vibrotactile feedback, performance with a myoelectric prosthesis can improve significantly. This implies it is possible to achieve the same benefits with vibrotactile feedback, which is cheaper and easier to implement than other forms of feedback."

    "title": "Reflections on the present and future of upper limb prostheses",
    "abstract": "Despite progress in research and media attention on active upper limb prostheses, presently the most common commercial upper limb prosthetic devices are not fundamentally different from solutions offered almost one century ago. Limited information transfer for both control and sensory-motor integration and challenges in socket technology have been major obstacles. By analysing the present state-of-the-art and academic achievements, we provide our opinion on the future of upper limb prostheses. We believe that surgical procedures for muscle reinnervation and osseointegration will become increasingly clinically relevant; muscle electrical signals will remain the main clinical means for prosthetic control; and chronic electrode implants, first in muscles (control), then in nerves (sensory feedback), will become viable clinical solutions. After decades of suspended clinically relevant progress, it is foreseeable that a new generation of upper limb prostheses will enter the market in the near future based on such advances, thereby offering substantial clinical benefit for patients."

    "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the use of muscles appropriate for partial-hand prostheses with those typically used for complete hand devices and to determine whether differences in their underlying neural substrates translate to different levels of myoelectric control.\nApproach: We developed a novel abstract myoelectric decoder based on motor learning. Three muscle pairs, namely, an intrinsic and independent, an intrinsic and synergist and finally, an extrinsic and antagonist, were tested during abstract myoelectric control. Feedback conditions probed the roles of feed-forward and feedback mechanisms.\nResults: Both performance levels and rates of improvement were significantly higher for intrinsic hand muscles relative to muscles of the forearm. Intrinsic hand muscles showed considerable improvement generalising to decoder use without visual feedback. Results indicate that visual feedback from the decoder is used for transitioning between muscle activity levels, but not for maintaining state. Both individual and group performance were found to be strongly related to motor variability.\nSignificance: Physiological differences inherent to the hand muscles can translate to improved prosthesis control. Our results support the use of motor learning based techniques for upper-limb myoelectric control and strongly argues for their utility in control of partial-hand prostheses. We provide evidence of myoelectric control skill acquisition and offer a formal definition for abstract decoding in the context of prosthetic control."

Applying concepts from precision medicine to neurorehabilitation is practicable and needed to establish realistic rehabilitation goals and to effectively allocate resources."

    "title": "Who May Benefit From Armeo Power Treatment? A Neurophysiological Approach to Predict Neurorehabilitation Outcomes",
    "abstract": "Background: The Armeo Power, a rehabilitation exoskeleton that allows early treatment of motor disabilities, provides intelligent arm support in a large 3-dimensional work space, thus enabling patients to perform intensive, repetitive, and goal-oriented exercises. This device could efficiently induce new connections and facilitate plasticity phenomena potentiation. Knowledge of the potential brain plasticity reservoir after brain damage constitutes a prerequisite for an optimal rehabilitation strategy.\nObjective: To identify potential neurophysiologic markers predicting the responsiveness of stroke patients to upper limb robotic treatment.\nDesign: Prospective cohort study.\nSetting: Behavioral and Robotic Neurorehabilitation Laboratory of IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino-Pulejo, Messina, Italy.\nPatients: We enrolled 35 patients who had sustained a first-ever ischemic supratentorial stroke at least 2 months before enrollment and had unilateral hemiplegia.\nMethods: All patients underwent 40 Armeo Power training sessions that lasted 1 hour each (ie, 5 times a week for 8 weeks).\nMain outcome measurements: We assessed the spasticity and motor function of the upper limb by means of the Modified Ashworth scale and Fugl-Meyer assessment, respectively. Moreover, we evaluated the cortical excitability and plasticity potential of the bilateral primary motor areas in response to the repetitive paired associative stimulation paradigm using transcranial magnetic stimulation and Armeo Power kinematic parameters.\nResults: The patients who showed significant repetitive paired associative stimulation aftereffects at baseline exhibited an evident increase of cortical plasticity in the affected hemisphere (motor evoked potential amplitude increase, P = .03), a decrease of interhemispheric inhibition (affected hemisphere cortical silent period duration decrease, P = .01; unaffected hemisphere cortical silent period duration increase, P = .004; repetitive paired associative stimulation aftereffect increase, P = .008). Such findings were paralleled by clinical improvements (Fugl-Meyer, P = .04) and Armeo Power kinematic improvements (elbow flexion/extension, P = .02; shoulder range of movement, P = .002).\nConclusions: Our data suggest that use of Armeo Power may improve upper limb motor function recovery as predicted by reshaping of cortical and transcallosal plasticity, according to the baseline cortical excitability.\nLevel of evidence: IV."

    "title": "A robot hand testbed designed for enhancing embodiment and functional neurorehabilitation of body schema in subjects with upper limb impairment or loss",
    "abstract": "Many upper limb amputees experience an incessant, post-amputation \"phantom limb pain\" and report that their missing limbs feel paralyzed in an uncomfortable posture. One hypothesis is that efferent commands no longer generate expected afferent signals, such as proprioceptive feedback from changes in limb configuration, and that the mismatch of motor commands and visual feedback is interpreted as pain. Non-invasive therapeutic techniques for treating phantom limb pain, such as mirror visual feedback (MVF), rely on visualizations of postural changes. Advances in neural interfaces for artificial sensory feedback now make it possible to combine MVF with a high-tech \"rubber hand\" illusion, in which subjects develop a sense of embodiment with a fake hand when subjected to congruent visual and somatosensory feedback. We discuss clinical benefits that could arise from the confluence of known concepts such as MVF and the rubber hand illusion, and new technologies such as neural interfaces for sensory feedback and highly sensorized robot hand testbeds, such as the \"BairClaw\" presented here. Our multi-articulating, anthropomorphic robot testbed can be used to study proprioceptive and tactile sensory stimuli during physical finger-object interactions. Conceived for artificial grasp, manipulation, and haptic exploration, the BairClaw could also be used for future studies on the neurorehabilitation of somatosensory disorders due to upper limb impairment or loss. A remote actuation system enables the modular control of tendon-driven hands. The artificial proprioception system enables direct measurement of joint angles and tendon tensions while temperature, vibration, and skin deformation are provided by a multimodal tactile sensor. The provision of multimodal sensory feedback that is spatiotemporally consistent with commanded actions could lead to benefits such as reduced phantom limb pain, and increased prosthesis use due to improved functionality and reduced cognitive burden."

    "title": "Robot-Aided Upper-limb Proprioceptive Training in Three-Dimensional Space",
    "abstract": "Proprioception, the ability to sense body position and limb movements in space without visual feedback, is one of the key factors in controlling body movements and performing activities of daily living. However, this capability might be affected after neural injuries such as stroke. Robotic platforms can be used to monitor and promote arm movements and, therefore, can assist in developing rehabilitation protocols that aim to improve proprioception through repetitive reaching motions without vision. The objective of this paper is to investigate if a robotic training protocol improves the end-position reaching proprioceptive sense in three-dimensional (3D) space. As an initial step towards clinical application, a robotic platform was employed to train the end-position proprioceptive sense in six healthy participants. During the training phase, volunteers used their dominant hand to reach without vision to two different targets in 3D space. Positions of these targets were carefully chosen to create a hand movement pattern similar to that used when self-feeding, which is an important activity of daily living. At the end of each training trial, participants were provided with visual feedback to help them move their hands to the exact locations confirmed through haptic feedback. Their performance was evaluated before and after the training in an assessment phase during which participants were asked to move from the start position to the same two targets as well as an additional third one without any visual or haptic feedback. The results from this study show significant improvements in overall reaching accuracy and trajectory smoothness, demonstrated by 41% decrease in the average end-position error and 13% reduction in the average index of curvature after the training. This research suggests the potential of designing robotic rehabilitation protocols for improving 3D proprioception."

    "title": "Spatio-temporal profile of brain activity during gentle touch investigated with magnetoencephalography",
    "abstract": "Positive affective touch plays a central role in social and inter-personal interactions. Low-threshold mechanoreceptive afferents, including slowly-conducting C-tactile (CT) afferents found in hairy skin, transmit such signals from gentle touch to the brain. Tactile signals are processed, in part, by the posterior insula, where it is the thought to be the primary target for CTs. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to assess brain activity evoked by gentle, naturalistic stroking touch on the arm delivered by a new MEG-compatible brush robot. We aimed to use high temporal resolution MEG to allow us to distinguish between brain responses from fast-conducting Aβ and slowly-conducting CT afferents. Brush strokes were delivered to the left upper arm and left forearm of 15 healthy participants. We hypothesized that late brain responses, due to slow CT afference, would appear with a time shift between the two different locations on the arm. Our results show that gentle touch rapidly activated somatosensory, motor, and cingulate regions within the first 100 ms of skin contact, which was driven by fast-conducting mechanoreceptive afference, and that these responses were sustained during touch. Peak latencies in the posterior insula were shifted as a function of stimulus location and temporally-separate posterior insula activations were induced by Aβ and CT afference that may modulate the emotional processing of gentle touch on hairy skin. We conclude that the detailed information regarding temporal and spatial brain activity from MEG provides new insights into the central processing of gentle, naturalistic touch, which is thought to underpin affective tactile interactions."

    "title": "Effect of a mixed reality-based intervention on arm, hand, and finger function on chronic stroke",
    "abstract": "Background: Virtual and mixed reality systems have been suggested to promote motor recovery after stroke. Basing on the existing evidence on motor learning, we have developed a portable and low-cost mixed reality tabletop system that transforms a conventional table in a virtual environment for upper limb rehabilitation. The system allows intensive and customized training of a wide range of arm, hand, and finger movements and enables interaction with tangible objects, while providing audiovisual feedback of the participants' performance in gamified tasks. This study evaluates the clinical effectiveness and the acceptance of an experimental intervention with the system in chronic stroke survivors.\nMethods: Thirty individuals with stroke were included in a reversal (A-B-A) study. Phase A consisted of 30 sessions of conventional physical therapy. Phase B consisted of 30 training sessions with the experimental system. Both interventions involved flexion and extension of the elbow, wrist, and fingers, and grasping of different objects. Sessions were 45-min long and were administered three to five days a week. The body structures (Modified Ashworth Scale), functions (Motricity Index, Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale), activities (Manual Function Test, Wolf Motor Function Test, Box and Blocks Test, Nine Hole Peg Test), and participation (Motor Activity Log) were assessed before and after each phase. Acceptance of the system was also assessed after phase B (System Usability Scale, Intrinsic Motivation Inventory).\nResults: Significant improvement was detected after the intervention with the system in the activity, both in arm function measured by the Wolf Motor Function Test (p < 0.01) and finger dexterity measured by the Box and Blocks Test (p < 0.01) and the Nine Hole Peg Test (p < 0.01); and participation (p < 0.01), which was maintained to the end of the study. The experimental system was reported as highly usable, enjoyable, and motivating.\nConclusions: Our results support the clinical effectiveness of mixed reality interventions that satisfy the motor learning principles for upper limb rehabilitation in chronic stroke survivors. This characteristic, together with the low cost of the system, its portability, and its acceptance could promote the integration of these systems in the clinical practice as an alternative to more expensive systems, such as robotic instruments."

    "title": "Audible Feedback Improves Internal Model Strength and Performance of Myoelectric Prosthesis Control",
    "abstract": "Myoelectric prosthetic devices are commonly used to help upper limb amputees perform activities of daily living, however amputees still lack the sensory feedback required to facilitate reliable and precise control. Augmented feedback may play an important role in affecting both short-term performance, through real-time regulation, and long-term performance, through the development of stronger internal models. In this work, we investigate the potential tradeoff between controllers that enable better short-term performance and those that provide sufficient feedback to develop a strong internal model. We hypothesize that augmented feedback may be used to mitigate this tradeoff, ultimately improving both short and long-term control. We used psychometric measures to assess the internal model developed while using a filtered myoelectric controller with augmented audio feedback, imitating classification-based control but with augmented regression-based feedback. In addition, we evaluated the short-term performance using a multi degree-of-freedom constrained-time target acquisition task. Results obtained from 24 able-bodied subjects show that an augmented feedback control strategy using audio cues enables the development of a stronger internal model than the filtered control with filtered feedback, and significantly better path efficiency than both raw and filtered control strategies. These results suggest that the use of augmented feedback control strategies may improve both short-term and long-term performance."

    "abstract": "Objective performance-based outcome measures (OMs) have the potential to provide unbiased and reproducible assessments of limb function. However, very few of these performance-based OMs have been validated for upper limb (UL) prosthesis users. OMs validated in other clinical populations (eg, neurologic or musculoskeletal conditions) could be used to fill gaps in existing performance-based OMs for UL amputees. Additionally, a joint review might reveal consistent gaps across multiple clinical populations. Therefore, the objective of this review was to systematically characterize prominent measures used in both sets of clinical populations with regard to (1) location of task performance around the body, (2) possible grips employed, (3) bilateral versus unilateral task participation, and (4) details of scoring mechanisms. A systematic literature search was conducted in EMBASE, Medline, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health electronic databases for variations of the following terms: stroke, musculoskeletal dysfunction, amputation, prosthesis, upper limb, outcome, assessments. Articles were included if they described performance-based OMs developed for disabilities of the UL. Results show most tasks were performed with 1 hand in the space directly in front of the participant. The tip, tripod, and cylindrical grips were most commonly used for the specific tasks. Few measures assessed sensation and movement quality. Overall, several limitations in OMs were identified. The solution to these limitations may be to modify and validate existing measures originally developed for other clinical populations as first steps to more aptly measure prosthesis use while more complete assessments for UL prosthesis users are being developed.\nLevel of evidence: Level III."

    "title": "Upper-Limb Robotic Exoskeletons for Neurorehabilitation: A Review on Control Strategies",
    "abstract": "Since the late 1990s, there has been a burst of research on robotic devices for poststroke rehabilitation. Robot-mediated therapy produced improvements on recovery of motor capacity; however, so far, the use of robots has not shown qualitative benefit over classical therapist-led training sessions, performed on the same quantity of movements. Multidegree-of-freedom robots, like the modern upper-limb exoskeletons, enable a distributed interaction on the whole assisted limb and can exploit a large amount of sensory feedback data, potentially providing new capabilities within standard rehabilitation sessions. Surprisingly, most publications in the field of exoskeletons focused only on mechatronic design of the devices, while little details were given to the control aspects. On the contrary, we believe a paramount aspect for robots potentiality lies on the control side. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a taxonomy of currently available control strategies for exoskeletons for neurorehabilitation, in order to formulate appropriate questions toward the development of innovative and improved control strategies."

    "title": "The Association Between Reorganization of Bilateral M1 Topography and Function in Response to Early Intensive Hand Focused Upper Limb Rehabilitation Following Stroke Is Dependent on Ipsilesional Corticospinal Tract Integrity",
    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are an established proxy of corticospinal excitability. As a binary measure, the presence (MEP+) or absence (MEP-) of ipsilesional hemisphere MEPs early following stroke is a robust indicator of long-term recovery, however this measure does not provide information about spatial cortical reorganization. MEPs have been systematically acquired over the sensorimotor cortex to \"map\" motor topography. In this investigation we compared the degree to which functional improvements resulting from early (<3 months post-stroke) intensive hand focused upper limb rehabilitation correlate with changes in motor topography between MEP+ and MEP- individuals. Following informed consent, 17 individuals (4 Female, 60.3 ± 9.4 years, 24.6 ± 24.01 days post first time stroke) received 8 one hour-sessions of training with virtual reality (VR)/Robotic simulations. Clinical tests [Box and Blocks Test (BBT), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFMA)], kinematic and kinetic assessments [finger Active Range of Motion (finger AROM), Maximum Pinch Force (MPF)], and bilateral TMS mapping of 5 hand muscles were performed prior to (PRE), directly following (POST), and 1 month following (1M) training. Participants were divided into two groups (MEP+, MEP-) based on whether an MEP was present in the affected first dorsal interosseous (FDI) at any time point. MEP+ individuals improved significantly more than MEP- individuals from PRE to 1M on the WMFT, BBT, and finger AROM scores. Ipsilesional hemisphere FDI area increased significantly with time in the MEP+ group. FDI area of the contralesional hemisphere was not significantly different across time points or groups. In the MEP+ group, significant correlations were observed between PRE-1M changes in ipsilesional FDI area and WMFT, BBT, and finger AROM, and contralesional FDI area and UEFMA and MPF. In the MEP- group, no significant correlations were found between changes in contralesional FDI area and functional outcomes. We report preliminary evidence in a small sample that patterns of recovery and the association of recovery to bilateral changes in motor topography may depend on integrity of the ipsilesional cortical spinal tract as assessed by the presence of TMS evoked MEPs."

    "title": "The clinical relevance of advanced artificial feedback in the control of a multi-functional myoelectric prosthesis",
    "abstract": "Background: To effectively replace the human hand, a prosthesis should seamlessly respond to user intentions but also convey sensory information back to the user. Restoration of sensory feedback is rated highly by the prosthesis users, and feedback is critical for grasping in able-bodied subjects. Nonetheless, the benefits of feedback in prosthetics are still debated. The lack of consensus is likely due to the complex nature of sensory feedback during prosthesis control, so that its effectiveness depends on multiple factors (e.g., task complexity, user learning).\nMethods: We evaluated the impact of these factors with a longitudinal assessment in six amputee subjects, using a clinical setup (socket, embedded control) and a range of tasks (box and blocks, block turn, clothespin and cups relocation). To provide feedback, we have proposed a novel vibrotactile stimulation scheme capable of transmitting multiple variables from a multifunction prosthesis. The subjects wore a bracelet with four by two uniformly placed vibro-tactors providing information on contact, prosthesis state (active function), and grasping force. The subjects also completed a questionnaire for the subjective evaluation of the feedback.\nResults: The tests demonstrated that feedback was beneficial only in the complex tasks (block turn, clothespin and cups relocation), and that the training had an important, task-dependent impact. In the clothespin relocation and block turn tasks, training allowed the subjects to establish successful feedforward control, and therefore, the feedback became redundant. In the cups relocation task, however, the subjects needed some training to learn how to properly exploit the feedback. The subjective evaluation of the feedback was consistently positive, regardless of the objective benefits. These results underline the multifaceted nature of closed-loop prosthesis control as, depending on the context, the same feedback interface can have different impact on performance. Finally, even if the closed-loop control does not improve the performance, it could be beneficial as it seems to improve the subjective experience.\nConclusions: Therefore, in this study we demonstrate, for the first time, the relevance of an advanced, multi-variable feedback interface for dexterous, multi-functional prosthesis control in a clinically relevant setting."

    "title": "Motor imagery classification of upper limb movements based on spectral domain features of EEG patterns",
    "abstract": "Surface electromyography pattern recognition methods have been widely applied to decode limb movement intentions for prosthesis control. These methods generally require amputees to provide sufficient myoelectric signals from their residual limb muscles. Previous studies have shown that amputees with high level amputation or neuromuscular disorder usually do not have sufficient residual limb muscles to provide enough myoelectric signals for accurate identification of limb movements. Electroencephalography (EEG), another bioelectric signal associated with limb movements has also been proposed and used for decoding the limb motion intents of humans. With an attempt to improve the performance of EEG-based method in identifying multiple classes of upper limb movement intents, four spectral domain features of EEG were proposed in this study. Motor imagery patterns associated with five different classes of imagined upper limb movements were distinctively decoded based on the four features extracted from 64-channel EEG recordings in four transhumeral amputees. Experimental results show that an average accuracy of 97.81% was achieved across all the subjects and limb movement classes. By applying a sequential channel selection method, an accuracy of around 95.00% was realized with about 20-channels of EEG. Thus, the proposed method might be potential for providing accurate control input for neuroprosthesis."

However, the true efficacy of such devices in ET remains unclear.\nMethods: A systematic literature review was conducted using standardized criteria regarding efficacy and comfortability. Devices focused on design or experimental testing in which tremor was simulated in a robot were excluded.\nResults: Out of 324 articles initially identified, 12 articles were included. Orthoses using biomechanical loading and neuromodulation with electrical stimulation, and external tremor cancelation devices, were the main interventions used to suppress tremor. All devices were designed to control tremor of the upper limbs at different anatomical locations. Overall, an average tremor attenuation of 50-98% was reported (level of evidence III). Interference with voluntary movements and portability was described as the main drawback.\nDiscussion: In conclusion, this review highlights the growing interest in emerging tremor control devices and the importance of assessing comfort without affecting voluntary movements. However, the level of evidence regarding the efficacy of these tremor control devices remains low. An integrated multidisciplinary combination approach of engineering, robotics, physiology, physiotherapy, and clinical assessment is needed to improve the quality of non-pharmacological interventions for ET."

Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The experimental group (n=17) received additional early sensorimotor robotic training, 4 hours a week for 5 weeks; the control group (n=18) was exposed to the robotic device, 30 minutes a week, twice a week, but the exercises were performed with the unimpaired upper limb. Training by robot consisted of peripheral manipulation of the shoulder and elbow of the impaired limb, correlated with visual stimuli.\nMain outcome measures: The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of upper-extremity function (shoulder/elbow and coordination and wrist/hand subsections) to measure each trained limb segment; the Medical Research Council (MRC) score to measure the strength of muscle force during 3 actions: shoulder abduction (MRC deltoid), elbow flexion (MRC biceps), and wrist flexion (MRC wrist flexors); the FIM instrument and its motor component; and the Trunk Control Test (TCT) and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).\nResults: Compared with the patients in the control group, the experimental group showed significant gains in motor impairment and functional recovery of the upper limb after robot therapy, as measured by the MRC deltoid (P< or =.05) and biceps (P<.05) scores, the FMA for the proximal upper arm (P<.05), the FIM instrument (P<.05), and the FIM motor score (P<.01); these gains were also sustained at the 3- and 8-month follow-up. The FMA and MRC wrist flexor test findings did not differ statistically either at the end of training or at the follow-up sessions. We found no significant differences in MAS and TCT in either group in any of the evaluations. No adverse effects occurred and the robotic approach was very well accepted.\nConclusions: Patients who received robotic therapy in addition to conventional therapy showed greater reductions in motor impairment and improvements in functional abilities. Robotic therapy may therefore effectively complement standard rehabilitation from the start, by providing therapeutic support for patients with poststroke plegic and paretic upper limb."

    "abstract": "Each year, approximately 185,000 Americans suffer the devastating loss of a limb. The effects of upper limb amputations are profound because a person's hands are tools for everyday functioning, expressive communication, and other uniquely human attributes. Despite the advancements in prosthetic technology, current upper limb prostheses are still limited in terms of complex motor control and sensory feedback. Sensory feedback is critical to restoring full functionality to amputated patients because it would relieve the cognitive burden of relying solely on visual input to monitor motor commands and provide tremendous psychological benefits. This article reviews the latest innovations in sensory feedback and argues in favor of peripheral nerve interfaces. First, the authors examine the structure of the peripheral nerve and its importance in the development of a sensory interface. Second, the authors discuss advancements in targeted muscle reinnervation and direct neural stimulation by means of intraneural electrodes. The authors then explore the future of prosthetic sensory feedback using innovative technologies for neural signaling, specifically, the sensory regenerative peripheral nerve interface and optogenetics. These breakthroughs pave the way for the development of a prosthetic limb with the ability to feel."

Here we utilize tactile information to provide active touch feedback to a prosthetic hand. First, we developed fingertip tactile sensors for producing biomimetic spiking responses for monitoring contact, release, and slip of an object grasped by a prosthetic hand. We convert the sensor output into pulses, mimicking the rapid and slowly adapting spiking responses of receptor afferents found in the human body. Second, we designed and implemented two neuromimetic event-based algorithms, Compliant Grasping and Slip Prevention, on a prosthesis to create a local closed-loop tactile feedback control system (i.e. tactile information is sent to the prosthesis). Grasping experiments were designed to assess the benefit of this biologically inspired neuromimetic tactile feedback to a prosthesis. Results from able-bodied and amputee subjects show the average number of objects that broke or slipped during grasping decreased by over 50% and the average time to complete a grasping task decreased by at least 10% for most trials when comparing neuromimetic tactile feedback with no feedback on a prosthesis. Our neuromimetic method of closed-loop tactile sensing is a novel approach to improving the function of upper limb prostheses."

    "title": "Skin Stretch Haptic Feedback to Convey Closure Information in Anthropomorphic, Under-Actuated Upper Limb Soft Prostheses",
    "abstract": "Restoring hand function in individuals with upper limb loss is a challenging task, made difficult by the complexity of human hands from both a functional and sensory point of view. Users of commercial prostheses, even sophisticated devices, must visually attend to the hand to know its state, since in most cases they are not provided with any direct sensory information. Among the different types of haptic feedback that can be delivered, particularly information on hand opening is likely to reduce the requirement of constant visual attention. In recent years, there has been a trend of using underactuated, compliant multi-fingered hands as upper limb prostheses, in part due to their simplicity and ease of use attributed to low degree-of-freedom (d.o.f.) actuation. The trend toward underactuation encourages the design of one d.o.f. haptic devices to provide intuitive sensory feedback from the prosthesis. However, mapping the closure of a multi-d.o.f. prosthetic hand to a simple and intuitive haptic cue is not a trivial task. In this paper, we explore the use of a one d.o.f. skin stretch haptic device, the rice haptic rocker, to provide intuitive proprioceptive feedback indicating overall hand closure of an underactuated prosthesis. The benefits and challenges of the system are assessed in multi-tasking and reduced vision scenarios for an object-size discrimination task, in an effort to simulate challenges in daily life, and are compared against the haptic resolution of the device using the just noticeable difference. Finally, an evaluation done with a prosthesis user, in the form of a truncated version of the Activities Measure for Upper Limb Amputees (AM-ULA), shows possible benefits of the addition of haptic feedback in tasks with reduced visual attention."

    "abstract": "Objective: Tactile feedback is critical to grip and object manipulation. Its absence results in reliance on visual and auditory cues. Our objective was to assess the effect of sensory feedback on task performance in individuals with limb loss.\nApproach: Stimulation of the peripheral nerves using implanted cuff electrodes provided two subjects with sensory feedback with intensity proportional to forces on the thumb, index, and middle fingers of their prosthetic hand during object manipulation. Both subjects perceived the sensation on their phantom hand at locations corresponding to the locations of the forces on the prosthetic hand. A bend sensor measured prosthetic hand span. Hand span modulated the intensity of sensory feedback perceived on the thenar eminence for subject 1 and the middle finger for subject 2. We performed three functional tests with the blindfolded subjects. First, the subject tried to determine whether or not a wooden block had been placed in his prosthetic hand. Second, the subject had to locate and remove magnetic blocks from a metal table. Third, the subject performed the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP). We also measured the subject's sense of embodiment with a survey and his self-confidence.\nMain results: Blindfolded performance with sensory feedback was similar to sighted performance in the wooden block and magnetic block tasks. Performance on the SHAP, a measure of hand mechanical function and control, was similar with and without sensory feedback. An embodiment survey showed an improved sense of integration of the prosthesis in self body image with sensory feedback.\nSignificance: Sensory feedback by peripheral nerve stimulation improved object discrimination and manipulation, embodiment, and confidence. With both forms of feedback, the blindfolded subjects tended toward results obtained with visual feedback."

Several control algorithms have been implemented in rehabilitation robots to develop a patient-cooperative strategy with the capacity to understand the intention of the user and provide suitable rehabilitation training. In this paper, we present an upper-limb motion pattern recognition method using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals with a support vector machine (SVM) to control a rehabilitation robot, ReRobot, which was built to conduct upper-limb rehabilitation training for post-stroke patients. For poststroke rehabilitation training using the ReRobot, the upper-limb motion of the patient's healthy side is first recognized by detecting and processing the sEMG signals; then, the ReRobot assists the impaired arm in conducting mirror rehabilitation therapy. To train and test the SVM model, five healthy subjects participated in the experiments and performed five standard upper-limb motions, including shoulder flexion, abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, and elbow joint flexion. Good accuracy was demonstrated in experimental results from the five healthy subjects. By recognizing the model motion of the healthy side, the rehabilitation robot can provide mirror therapy to the affected side. This method can be used as a control strategy of upper-limb rehabilitation robots for self-rehabilitation training with stroke patients."

This paper presents a literature review on needs analysis of upper limb prosthesis users, and points out the main critical aspects of the current prosthetic solutions, in terms of users satisfaction and activities of daily living they would like to perform with the prosthetic device. The ultimate goal is to provide design inputs in the prosthetic field and, contemporary, increase user satisfaction rates and reduce device abandonment. A list of requirements for upper limb prostheses is proposed, grounded on the performed analysis on user needs. It wants to (i) provide guidelines for improving the level of acceptability and usefulness of the prosthesis, by accounting for hand functional and technical aspects; (ii) propose a control architecture of PNS-based prosthetic systems able to satisfy the analyzed user wishes; (iii) provide hints for improving the quality of the methods (e.g., questionnaires) adopted for understanding the user satisfaction with their prostheses."

    "title": "Four Extremity Amputation and Bionic Prosthesis Supply after Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation: A Follow-Up on Functionality and Quality of Life after Bionic Prosthesis Supply",
    "abstract": "Background: Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is a rare symptom complex that causes embolisms within the microvasculature and extensive necrosis of the skin and the acres. During surgical decision-making, preserving functionally important structures must be weighed against radical debridement. The aim was to analyze functional recovery and quality of life of patients sustaining amputations from disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and supplied with bionic prostheses.\nMethods: A monocentric, retrospective review of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy after sepsis was conducted from 2016 to 2018. After initial reconstruction and intensive care treatment, patients were provided with bionic prosthetic devices. A follow-up survey measuring function and quality of life was performed.\nResults: Three patients (mean: 45 years; median: 50 years) were analyzed. The first necrectomy and amputation were performed, on average, after >4 weeks post-symptom onset. All patients required re-amputation, averaging two or one re-amputations in the right or left upper extremity, respectively, and one in the lower extremities. On average, 12 operations for reconstruction of skin defects were required (x͂=8). On average, patients tolerated their prostheses for 5.67 h per day. Satisfaction metrics were either sufficient (SF-36, x̅=69) or moderate (TAPES-R, x̅=4.7). Physical skills were rated poor to fair (average TAPES-R=2.67).\nConclusion: Supplying bionic prostheses after DIC yielded sufficient to moderate results. However, prothesis weight, signal transmission disorders, and repeated functional failures were suboptimal. For extensive stump scarring, implantable signal electrodes may improve signal transmission."

    "title": "Sensory feedback for upper limb prostheses",
    "abstract": "In this chapter, we discuss the neurophysiological basis of how to provide sensory feedback to users with an upper limb prosthesis and discuss some of the theoretical issues that need to be considered when directly stimulating neurons in the somatosensory system. We focus on technologies that are currently available and discuss approaches that are most likely to succeed in providing natural perception from the artificial hand to the user. First, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of providing feedback by stimulating directly the remaining afferents that originally innervated the arm and hand. In particular, we pay close attention to the normal functional roles that the peripheral afferents play in perception. What are the consequences and implications of stimulating these afferents? We then discuss whether it is reasonable to stimulate neurons in the ascending pathways that carry the information from the afferents to the cortex or directly in neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex. We show that for some modalities there are advantages for stimulating in the spinal cord, while for others it is advantageous to stimulate directly in the somatosensory cortex. Finally, we discuss results from a current experiment in which we used electrical stimuli in primary somatosensory cortex to restore the percept of the intensity of a mechanical probe indented into the hand. The results suggest that the simple percept of stimulus intensity can be provided to the animal from a single finger using four electrodes. We propose that significantly more electrodes will be needed to reproduce more complex aspects of tactile perception."

    "abstract": "Progress in myoelectric control technology has over the years been incremental, due in part to the alternating focus of the R&D between control methodology and device hardware. The technology has over the past 50 years or so moved from single muscle control of a single prosthesis function to muscle group activity control of multifunction prostheses. Central to these changes have been developments in the means of extracting information from the myoelectric signal. This paper gives an overview of the myoelectric signal processing challenge, a brief look at the challenge from an historical perspective, the state-of-the-art in myoelectric signal processing for prosthesis control, and an indication of where this field is heading. The paper demonstrates that considerable progress has been made in providing clients with useful and reliable myoelectric communication channels, and that exciting work and developments are on the horizon."

    "abstract": "Background: User feedback about grasping force and hand aperture is very important in object handling with myoelectric forearm prostheses but is lacking in current prostheses. Vibrotactile feedback increases the performance of healthy subjects in virtual grasping tasks, but no extensive validation on potential users has been performed.\nObjectives: Investigate the performance of upper-limb loss subjects in grasping tasks with vibrotactile stimulation, providing hand aperture, and grasping force feedback.\nStudy design: Cross-over trial.\nMethods: A total of 10 subjects with upper-limb loss performed virtual grasping tasks while perceiving vibrotactile feedback. Hand aperture feedback was provided through an array of coin motors and grasping force feedback through a single miniature stimulator or an array of coin motors. Objects with varying sizes and weights had to be grasped by a virtual hand.\nResults: Percentages correctly applied hand apertures and correct grasping force levels were all higher for the vibrotactile feedback condition compared to the no-feedback condition. With visual feedback, the results were always better compared to the vibrotactile feedback condition. Task durations were comparable for all feedback conditions.\nConclusion: Vibrotactile grasping force and hand aperture feedback improves grasping performance of subjects with upper-limb loss. However, it should be investigated whether this is of additional value in daily-life tasks.\nClinical relevance: This study is a first step toward the implementation of sensory vibrotactile feedback for users of myoelectric forearm prostheses. Grasping force feedback is crucial for optimal object handling, and hand aperture feedback is essential for reduction of required visual attention. Grasping performance with feedback is evaluated for the potential users."

    "title": "The benefits of sensation on the experience of a hand: A qualitative case series",
    "abstract": "Background: The experience of upper limb loss involves loss of both functional capabilities and the sensory connection of a hand. Research studies to restore sensation to persons with upper limb loss with neural interfaces typically measure outcomes through standardized functional tests or quantitative surveys. However, these types of metrics cannot fully capture the personal experience of living with limb loss or the impact of sensory restoration on this experience. Qualitative studies can demonstrate the viewpoints and priorities of specific persons or groups and reveal the underlying conceptual structure of various aspects of their experiences.\nMethods and findings: Following a home use trial of a neural-connected, sensory-enabled prosthesis, two persons with upper limb loss were interviewed about their experiences using the sensory restoration system in unsupervised, unconstrained settings. We used grounded theory methodology to examine their experiences, perspectives, and opinions about the sensory restoration system. We then developed a model to describe the impact of sensation on the experience of a hand for persons with upper limb loss.\nConclusions: The experience of sensation was complex and included concepts such as the naturalness of the experience, sensation modality, and the usefulness of the sensory information. Sensation was critical for outcome acceptance, and contributed to prosthesis embodiment, confidence, reduced focus and attention for using the prosthesis, and social interactions. Embodiment, confidence, and social interactions were also key determinants of outcome acceptance. This model provides a unified framework to study and understand the impact of sensation on the experience of limb loss and to understand outcome acceptance following upper limb loss more broadly."

    "title": "Motor unit drive: a neural interface for real-time upper limb prosthetic control",
    "abstract": "Objective: Modern prosthetic limbs have made strident gains in recent years, incorporating terminal electromechanical devices that are capable of mimicking the human hand. However, access to these advanced control capabilities has been prevented by fundamental limitations of amplitude-based myoelectric neural interfaces, which have remained virtually unchanged for over four decades. Consequently, nearly 23% of adults and 32% of children with major traumatic or congenital upper-limb loss abandon regular use of their myoelectric prosthesis. To address this healthcare need, we have developed a noninvasive neural interface technology that maps natural motor unit increments of neural control and force into biomechanically informed signals for improved prosthetic control.\nApproach: Our technology, referred to as motor unit drive (MU Drive), utilizes real-time machine learning algorithms for directly measuring motor unit firings from surface electromyographic signals recorded from residual muscles of an amputated or congenitally missing limb. The extracted firings are transformed into biomechanically informed signals based on the force generating properties of individual motor units to provide a control source that represents the intended movement.\nMain results: We evaluated the characteristics of the MU Drive control signals and compared them to conventional amplitude-based myoelectric signals in healthy subjects as well as subjects with congenital or traumatic trans-radial limb-loss. Our analysis established a vital proof-of-concept: MU Drive provides a more responsive real-time signal with improved smoothness and more faithful replication of intended limb movement that overcomes the trade-off between performance and latency inherent to amplitude-based myoelectric methods.\nSignificance: MU Drive is the first neural interface for prosthetic control that provides noninvasive real-time access to the natural motor control mechanisms of the human nervous system. This new neural interface holds promise for improving prosthetic function by achieving advanced control that better reflects the user intent. Beyond the immediate advantages in the field of prosthetics, MU Drive provides an innovative alternative for advancing the control of exoskeletons, assistive devices, and other robotic rehabilitation applications."

    "abstract": "Purpose: New rehabilitation strategies for post-stroke upper limb rehabilitation employing visual stimulation show promising results, however, cost-efficient and clinically feasible ways to provide these interventions are still lacking. An integral step is to translate recent technological advances, such as in virtual and augmented reality, into therapeutic practice to improve outcomes for patients. This requires research on the adaptation of the technology for clinical use as well as on the appropriate guidelines and protocols for sustainable integration into therapeutic routines. Here, we present and evaluate a novel and affordable augmented reality system (Augmented Reflection Technology, ART) in combination with a validated mirror therapy protocol for upper limb rehabilitation after stroke.\nMethod: We evaluated components of the therapeutic intervention, from the patients' and the therapists' points of view in a clinical feasibility study at a rehabilitation centre. We also assessed the integration of ART as an adjunct therapy for the clinical rehabilitation of subacute patients at two different hospitals.\nResults: The results showed that the combination and application of the Berlin Protocol for Mirror Therapy together with ART was feasible for clinical use. This combination was integrated into the therapeutic plan of subacute stroke patients at the two clinical locations where the second part of this research was conducted.\nConclusions: Our findings pave the way for using technology to provide mirror therapy in clinical settings and show potential for the more effective use of inpatient time and enhanced recoveries for patients. Implications for Rehabilitation Computerised Mirror Therapy is feasible for clinical use Augmented Reflection Technology can be integrated as an adjunctive therapeutic intervention for subacute stroke patients in an inpatient setting Virtual Rehabilitation devices such as Augmented Reflection Technology have considerable potential to enhance stroke rehabilitation."

    "title": "Myocontrol is closed-loop control: incidental feedback is sufficient for scaling the prosthesis force in routine grasping",
    "abstract": "Background: Sensory feedback is critical for grasping in able-bodied subjects. Consequently, closing the loop in upper-limb prosthetics by providing artificial sensory feedback to the amputee is expected to improve the prosthesis utility. Nevertheless, even though amputees rate the prospect of sensory feedback high, its benefits in daily life are still very much debated. We argue that in order to measure the potential functional benefit of artificial sensory feedback, the baseline open-loop performance needs to be established.\nMethods: The myoelectric control of naïve able-bodied subjects was evaluated during modulation of electromyographic signals (EMG task), and grasping with a prosthesis (Prosthesis task). The subjects needed to activate the wrist flexor muscles and close the prosthesis to reach a randomly selected target level (routine grasping). To assess the baseline performance, the tasks were performed with a different extent of implicit feedback (proprioception, prosthesis motion and sound). Finally, the prosthesis task was repeated with explicit visual force feedback. The subjects' ability to scale the prosthesis command/force was assessed by testing for a statistically significant increase in the median of the generated commands/forces between neighboring levels. The quality of control was evaluated by computing the median absolute error (MAE) with respect to the target.\nResults: The subjects could successfully scale their motor commands and generated prosthesis forces across target levels in all tasks, even with the least amount of implicit feedback (only muscle proprioception, EMG task). In addition, the deviation of the generated commands/forces from the target levels decreased with additional feedback. However, the increase in implicit feedback, from proprioception to prosthesis motion and sound, seemed to have a more substantial effect than the final introduction of explicit feedback. Explicit feedback improved the performance mainly at the higher target-force levels.\nConclusions: The study establishes the baseline performance of myoelectric control and prosthesis grasping force. The results demonstrate that even without additional feedback, naïve subjects can effectively modulate force with good accuracy with respect to that achieved when increasing the amount of feedback information."

    "abstract": "Human grasping and manipulation control critically depends on tactile feedback. Without this feedback, the ability for fine control of a prosthesis is limited in upper limb amputees. Although various approaches have been investigated in the past, at present there is no commercially available device able to restore tactile feedback in upper limb amputees. Based on the Discrete Event-driven Sensory feedback Control (DESC) policy we present a device able to deliver short-lasting vibrotactile feedback to transradial amputees using commercially available myoelectric hands. The device (DESC-glove) comprises sensorized thimbles to be placed on the prosthesis digits, a battery-powered electronic board, and vibrating units embedded in an arm-cuff being transiently activated when the prosthesis makes and breaks contact with objects. The consequences of using the DESC-glove were evaluated in a longitudinal study. Five transradial amputees were equipped with the device for one month at home. Through a simple test proposed here for the first time-the virtual eggs test-we demonstrate the effectiveness of the device for prosthetic control in daily life conditions. In the future the device could be easily exploited as an add-on to complement myoelectric prostheses or even embedded in prosthetic sockets to enhance their control by upper limb amputees."

    "title": "Discrimination and Recognition of Phantom Finger Sensation Through Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation",
    "abstract": "Tactile sensory feedback would make a significant contribution to the state-of-the-art prosthetic hands for achieving dexterous manipulation over objects. Phantom finger sensation, also called referred sensation of lost fingers, can be noninvasively evoked by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of the phantom finger territories (PFTs) near the stump for upper-limb amputees. As such, intuitive sensations pertaining to lost fingers could be non-invasively generated. However, the encoding of stimulation parameters into tactile sensations that can be intuitively interpreted by the users remains a significant challenge. Further, how discriminative such artificial tactile sensation with TENS of the PFTs is still unknown. In this study, we systematically characterized the tactile discrimination across different phantom fingers on the stump skin by TENS among six subjects. Charge-balanced and biphasic stimulating current pulses were adopted. The pulse amplitude (PA), the pulse frequency (PF) and the pulse width (PW) were modulated to evaluate the detection threshold, perceived touch intensity, and the just-noticeable difference (JND) of the phantom finger sensation. Particularly, the recognition of phantom fingers under simultaneous stimulation was assessed. The psychophysical experiments revealed that subjects could discern fine variations of stimuli with comfortable sensation of phantom fingers including D1 (phantom thumb), D2 (phantom index finger), D3 (Phantom middle finger), and D5 (Phantom pinky finger). With respect to PA, PF, and PW modulations, the detection thresholds across the four phantom fingers were achieved by the method of constant stimuli based on a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) paradigm. For each modulation, the perceived intensity, which was indexed by skin indentations on the contralateral intact finger pulp, reinforced gradually with enhancing stimuli within lower-intensity range. Particularly, the curve of the indentation depth vs. PF almost reached a plateau with PF more than 200 Hz. Moreover, the performance of phantom finger recognition deteriorated with the increasing number of phantom fingers under simultaneous TENS. For one, two and four stimulating channels, the corresponding recognition rate of an individual PFT were respective 85.83, 67.67, and 46.44%. The results of the present work would provide direct guidelines regarding the optimization of stimulating strategies to deliver artificial tactile sensation by TENS for clinical applications."

    "title": "Electroencephalographic markers of robot-aided therapy in stroke patients for the evaluation of upper limb rehabilitation",
    "abstract": "Stroke is the leading cause of permanent disability in developed countries; its effects may include sensory, motor, and cognitive impairment as well as a reduced ability to perform self-care and participate in social and community activities. A number of studies have shown that the use of robotic systems in upper limb motor rehabilitation programs provides safe and intensive treatment to patients with motor impairments because of a neurological injury. Furthermore, robot-aided therapy was shown to be well accepted and tolerated by all patients; however, it is not known whether a specific robot-aided rehabilitation can induce beneficial cortical plasticity in stroke patients. Here, we present a procedure to study neural underpinning of robot-aided upper limb rehabilitation in stroke patients. Neurophysiological recordings use the following: (a) 10-20 system electroencephalographic (EEG) electrode montage; (b) bipolar vertical and horizontal electrooculographies; and (c) bipolar electromyography from the operating upper limb. Behavior monitoring includes the following: (a) clinical data and (b) kinematic and dynamic of the operant upper limb movements. Experimental conditions include the following: (a) resting state eyes closed and eyes open, and (b) robotic rehabilitation task (maximum 80 s each block to reach 4-min EEG data; interblock pause of 1 min). The data collection is performed before and after a program of 30 daily rehabilitation sessions. EEG markers include the following: (a) EEG power density in the eyes-closed condition; (b) reactivity of EEG power density to eyes opening; and (c) reactivity of EEG power density to robotic rehabilitation task. The above procedure was tested on a subacute patient (29 poststroke days) and on a chronic patient (21 poststroke months). After the rehabilitation program, we observed (a) improved clinical condition; (b) improved performance during the robotic task; (c) reduced delta rhythms (1-4 Hz) and increased alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz) during the resting state eyes-closed condition; (d) increased alpha desynchronization to eyes opening; and (e) decreased alpha desynchronization during the robotic rehabilitation task. We conclude that the present procedure is suitable for evaluation of the neural underpinning of robot-aided upper limb rehabilitation."

    "title": "Artificial tactile and proprioceptive feedback improves performance and confidence on object identification tasks",
    "abstract": "Somatosensory feedback of the hand is essential for object identification. Without somatosensory feedback, individuals cannot reliably determine the size or compliance of an object. Electrical nerve stimulation can restore localized tactile and proprioceptive feedback with intensity discrimination capability similar to natural sensation. We hypothesized that adding artificial somatosensation improves object recognition accuracy when using a prosthesis. To test this hypothesis, we provided different forms of sensory feedback-tactile, proprioceptive, or both-to two subjects with upper limb loss. The subjects were asked to identify the size or mechanical compliance of different foam blocks placed in the prosthetic hand while visually and audibly blinded. During trials, we did not inform the subjects of their performance, but did ask them about their confidence in correctly identifying objects. Finally, we recorded applied pressures during object interaction. Subjects were free to use any strategy they chose to examine the objects. Object identification was most accurate with both tactile and proprioceptive feedback. The relative importance of each type of feedback, however, depended on object characteristics and task. Sensory feedback increased subject confidence and was directly correlated with accuracy. Subjects applied less pressure to the objects when they had tactile pressure feedback. Artificial somatosensory feedback improves object recognition and the relative importance of tactile versus proprioceptive feedback depends on the test set. We believe this test battery provides an effective means to assess the impact of sensory restoration and the relative contribution of different forms of feedback (tactile vs. kinesthetic) within the neurorehabilitation field."

    "title": "Restoring tactile and proprioceptive sensation through a brain interface",
    "abstract": "Somatosensation plays a critical role in the dexterous manipulation of objects, in emotional communication, and in the embodiment of our limbs. For upper-limb neuroprostheses to be adopted by prospective users, prosthetic limbs will thus need to provide sensory information about the position of the limb in space and about objects grasped in the hand. One approach to restoring touch and proprioception consists of electrically stimulating neurons in somatosensory cortex in the hopes of eliciting meaningful sensations to support the dexterous use of the hands, promote their embodiment, and perhaps even restore the affective dimension of touch. In this review, we discuss the importance of touch and proprioception in everyday life, then describe approaches to providing artificial somatosensory feedback through intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). We explore the importance of biomimicry--the elicitation of naturalistic patterns of neuronal activation--and that of adaptation--the brain's ability to adapt to novel sensory input, and argue that both biomimicry and adaptation will play a critical role in the artificial restoration of somatosensation. We also propose that the documented re-organization that occurs after injury does not pose a significant obstacle to brain interfaces. While still at an early stage of development, sensory restoration is a critical step in transitioning upper-limb neuroprostheses from the laboratory to the clinic."

    "title": "Vestibular feedback maintains reaching accuracy during body movement",
    "abstract": "Key points: Reaching movements can be perturbed by vestibular input, but the function of this response is unclear. Here, we applied galvanic vestibular stimulation concurrently with real body movement while subjects maintained arm position either fixed in space or fixed with respect to their body. During the fixed-in-space conditions, galvanic vestibular stimulation caused large changes in arm trajectory consistent with a compensatory response to maintain upper-limb accuracy in the face of body movement. Galvanic vestibular stimulation responses were absent during the body-fixed task, demonstrating task dependency in vestibular control of the upper limb. The results suggest that the function of vestibular-evoked arm movements is to maintain the accuracy of the upper limb during unpredictable body movement, but only when reaching in an earth-fixed reference frame.\nAbstract: When using our arms to interact with the world, unintended body motion can introduce movement error. A mechanism that could detect and compensate for such motion would be beneficial. Observations of arm movements evoked by vestibular stimulation provide some support for this mechanism. However, the physiological function underlying these artificially evoked movements is unclear from previous research. For such a mechanism to be functional, it should operate only when the arm is being controlled in an earth-fixed rather than a body-fixed reference frame. In the latter case, compensation would be unnecessary and even deleterious. To test this hypothesis, subjects were gently rotated in a chair while being asked to maintain their outstretched arm pointing towards either earth-fixed or body-fixed memorized targets. Galvanic vestibular stimulation was applied concurrently during rotation to isolate the influence of vestibular input, uncontaminated by inertial factors. During the earth-fixed task, galvanic vestibular stimulation produced large polarity-dependent corrections in arm position. These corrections mimicked those evoked when chair velocity was altered without any galvanic vestibular stimulation, indicating a compensatory arm response to a sensation of altered body motion. In stark contrast, corrections were completely absent during the body-fixed task, despite the same chair movement profile and arm posture. These effects persisted when we controlled for differences in limb kinematics between the two tasks. Our results demonstrate that vestibular control of the upper limb maintains reaching accuracy during unpredictable body motion. The observation that such responses occurred only when reaching within an earth-fixed reference frame confirms the functional nature of vestibular-evoked arm movement."

    "title": "Quantification of upper limb position sense using an exoskeleton and a virtual reality display",
    "abstract": "Background: Proprioceptive sense plays a significant role in the generation and correction of skilled movements and, consequently, in most activities of daily living. We developed a new proprioception assessment protocol that enables the quantification of elbow position sense without using the opposite arm, involving active movement of the evaluated limb or relying on working memory. The aims of this descriptive study were to validate this assessment protocol by quantifying the elbow position sense of healthy adults, before using it in individuals who sustained a stroke, and to investigate its test-retest reliability.\nMethods: Elbow joint position sense was quantified using a robotic device and a virtual reality system. Two assessments were performed, by the same evaluator, with a one-week interval. While the participant's arms and hands were occluded from vision, the exoskeleton passively moved the dominant arm from an initial to a target position. Then, a virtual arm representation was projected on a screen placed over the participant's arm. This virtual representation and the real arm were not perfectly superimposed, however. Participants had to indicate verbally the relative position of their arm (more flexed or more extended; two-alternative forced choice paradigm) compared to the virtual representation. Each participant completed a total of 136 trials, distributed in three phases. The angular differences between the participant's arm and the virtual representation ranged from 1° to 27° and changed pseudo-randomly across trials. No feedback about results was provided to the participants during the task. A discrimination threshold was statistically extracted from a sigmoid curve fit representing the relationship between the angular difference and the percentage of successful trials. Test-retest reliability was evaluated with 3 different complementary approaches, i.e. a Bland-Altman analysis, an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and a standard error of measurement (SEm).\nResults: Thirty participants (24.6 years old; 17 males, 25 right-handed) completed both assessments. The mean discrimination thresholds were 7.0 ± 2.4 (mean ± standard deviation) and 5.9 ± 2.1 degrees for the first and the second assessment session, respectively. This small difference between assessments was significant (- 1.1 ± 2.2 degrees), however. The assessment protocol was characterized by a fair to good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.47).\nConclusion: This study demonstrated the potential of this assessment protocol to objectively quantify elbow position sense in healthy individuals. Futures studies will validate this protocol in older adults and in individuals who sustained a stroke."

    "title": "A review of methods for achieving upper limb movement following spinal cord injury through hybrid muscle stimulation and robotic assistance",
    "abstract": "Individuals with tetraplegia, typically attributed to spinal cord injuries (SCI) at the cervical level, experience significant health care costs and loss of independence due to their limited reaching and grasping capabilities. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a promising intervention to restore arm and hand function because it activates a person's own paralyzed muscles; however, NMES sometimes lacks the accuracy and repeatability necessary to position the limb for functional tasks, and repeated muscle stimulation can lead to fatigue. Robotic devices have the potential to restore function when used as assistive devices to supplement or replace limited or lost function of the upper limb following SCI. Unfortunately, most robotic solutions are bulky or require significant power to operate, limiting their applicability to restore functional independence in a home environment. Combining NMES and robotic support systems into a single hybrid neuroprosthesis is compelling, since the robotic device can supplement the action of the muscles and improve repeatability and accuracy. Research groups have begun to explore applications of movement assistance for individuals with spinal cord injury using these technologies in concert. In this review, we present the state of the art in hybrid NMES-orthotic systems for upper limb movement restoration following spinal cord injury, and suggest areas for emphasis necessary to move the field forward. Currently, NMES-robotic systems use either surface or implanted electrodes to stimulate muscles, with rigid robotic supports holding the limb against gravity, or providing assistance in reaching movements. Usability of such systems outside of the lab or clinic is limited due to the complexity of both the mechanical components, stimulation systems, and human-machine interfaces. Assessment of system and participant performance is not reported in a standardized way. Future directions should address wearability through improvements in component technologies and user interfaces. Further, increased integration of the control action between NMES and robotic subsystems to reanimate the limb should be pursued. Standardized reporting of system performance and expanded clinical assessments of these systems are also needed. All of these advancements are critical to facilitate translation from lab to home."

This means of control has been used extensively for over 30 years, during which time these systems have become reliable and durable in most situations. Myoelectric control, or any other prosthetic control scheme, should not be considered as the optimal control for arm prostheses, but rather as one of the several effective ways of producing desired function. Advanced clinical practice calls for a blending of all control schemes, as appropriate, to allow the prosthesis to serve the intentions of the user efficiently and with little mental effort. Technology continues to change, bringing with it new and sometimes better ways of fitting amputees. Microprocessors and programmable controllers have opened new and exciting avenues for improvement in function. New, and as of yet unidentified, electronic and mechanical advances are certainly on the horizon. There is much work to be done before upper limb prostheses rightfully are called arm replacements. But progress is occurring and advances are being made toward the goal of replacing the function and appearance of that marvelous tool, the human arm."

    "abstract": "Prosthetic hands are important tools for improving the lives of upper limb amputees, yet most devices lack the ability to provide a sense of touch back to the user. Recent improvements have been made in electromyography (EMG) prosthesis control as well as in biologically relevant tactile sensors to provide sensory feedback to amputees through nerve stimulation. However, sensory feedback has been designed heuristically, which can lead to either unnatural sensations or to excessive feedback that bothers the user. In this study, we apply optimal control techniques to synthesize sensory feedback to the user, and to synthesize the conversion from EMG to an actuation command to the prosthesis. Specifically, we construct a feedback control system architecture and solve the $H_{\\infty }$ model matching problem to make the closed-loop user-prosthetic system to behave like a pre-specified ideal system in response to elemental inputs (e.g. impulse, step, etc). We design feedback controllers assuming that human and prosthetic components behave in a linear fashion as a proof-of-concept, and the closed-loop system is able to match ideal systems that are slow, fast and that have both slow and fast dynamics (like healthy humans)."

    "abstract": "With the loss of function of an upper extremity because of stroke or spinal cord injury or a physical loss from amputation, an individual's life is forever changed, and activities that were once routine become a magnitude more difficult. Much research and effort have been put into developing advanced robotic prostheses to restore upper extremity function. For patients with upper extremity amputations, previously crude prostheses have evolved to become exceptionally functional. Because the upper extremities can perform a wide variety of activities, several types of upper extremity prostheses are available ranging from passive cosmetic limbs to externally powered robotic limbs. In addition, new developments in brain-machine interface are poised to revolutionize how patients can control these advanced prostheses using their thoughts alone. For patients with spinal cord injury or stroke, functional electrical stimulation promises to provide the most sophisticated prosthetic limbs possible by reanimating paralyzed arms of these patients. Advances in technology and robotics continue to help patients recover vital function. This article examines the latest neurorestorative technologies for patients who have either undergone amputation or lost the use of their upper extremities secondary to stroke or spinal cord injury."

    "abstract": "There are some practical factors, such as arm position change and donning/doffing, which prevent robust myoelectric control. The objective of this study is to precisely characterize the impacts of the two representative factors on myoelectric controllability in practical control situations, thereby providing useful references that can be potentially used to find better solutions for clinically reliable myoelectric control. To this end, a real-time target acquisition task was performed by fourteen subjects including one individual with congenital upper-limb deficiency, where the impacts of arm position change, donning/doffing and a combination of both factors on control performance was systematically evaluated. The changes in online performance were examined with seven different performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate various aspects of myoelectric controllability. As a result, arm position change significantly affects offline prediction accuracy, but not online control performance due to real-time feedback, thereby showing no significant correlation between offline and online performance. Donning/doffing was still problematic in online control conditions. It was further observed that no benefit was attained when using a control model trained with multiple position data in terms of arm position change, and the degree of electrode shift caused by donning/doffing was not severely associated with the degree of performance loss under practical conditions (around 1 cm electrode shift). Since this study is the first to concurrently investigate the impacts of arm position change and donning/doffing in practical myoelectric control situations, all findings of this study provide new insights into robust myoelectric control with respect to arm position change and donning/doffing."

A robotic therapy system was developed to provide feedback for specific upper extremity movements (gestures) which are therapeutically desirable. The purpose of this study was to compare changes in forearm supination/pronation or wrist extension/flexion motion following conventional therapy and gestural robotic feedback therapy intervention. Six subjects with cerebral palsy (ages 5-18, GMFCS level IV--three subjects, level III--one subject, and level I--two subjects) participated in a blinded crossover design study of conventional and robotic feedback therapy targeting either forearm supination or wrist extension. Functional upper extremity motion at baseline and following conventional and robotic feedback therapy interventions were obtained using a motion capture system by personnel blinded to the intervention order. All activities were approved by IRB. Use of the robotic feedback system did result in slightly increased movement in the targeted gesture without change in untargeted motions. Data also suggest a decrease in both agonist and antagonist motion following conventional therapy intervention. Results suggest improved motion when robotic feedback therapy intervention precedes conventional therapy intervention. Robotic feedback therapy is no different than conventional therapy to improve supination or wrist extension function in upper extremity impairments of children with cerebral palsy when changes were considered as aggregate data. In this very small group of diverse patients, individual subject results suggested that intervention order could be responsible for obscuring differences due to intervention type. Outcomes from several individual subjects suggest that results could be different given a more homogeneous group of subjects which future studies should be considered to ultimately determine efficacy of the robotic feedback therapy. Future studies should also address efficacy in other neuromuscular patient populations."

    "title": "Giuliano Vanghetti and the innovation of \"cineplastic operations",
    "abstract": "Objective: Developing functional artificial limbs for amputees has been a centuries-old challenge in medicine. We review the mechanical and neurologic principles of \"cineplastic operations\" and \"plastic motors\" used to restore movements in prostheses, with special attention to the work of Giuliano Vanghetti.\nMethods: We evaluated original publications describing cineplastic operations, biographic information, writings, drawings, and unpublished letters from the Vanghetti library, preserved in Empoli, Italy, and performed a bibliographic search and comparison for similar procedures in the literature.\nResults: Vanghetti's method for cineplastic operations differs from similar previous methods, being the first aimed at exploiting natural movements of the remnant muscles to activate the mechanical prosthesis, and the first to do so by directly connecting the prosthesis to the residual muscles and tendons. This represented a frame-changing innovation for that time and paved the way for current neuroprosthetic approaches. The first description of the method was published in 1898 and human studies started in 1900. The results of these studies were presented in 1905 and published in 1906 in Plastic and Kinematic Prosthesis. A German surgeon, Ferdinand Sauerbruch, often acknowledged as the inventor of the method, published his first results in 1915.\nConclusions: Vanghetti was the first to accurately perform and describe cineplastic operations for patients following an upper arm amputation. He considered the neurologic implications of the problem and, perhaps in an effort to provide more appropriate proprioceptive feedback, he intuitively applied the prostheses so that they were functionally activated by the muscles of the proximal stump."

    "title": "Brain network involved in visual processing of movement stimuli used in upper limb robotic training: an fMRI study",
    "abstract": "Background: The potential of robot-mediated therapy and virtual reality in neurorehabilitation is becoming of increasing importance. However, there is limited information, using neuroimaging, on the neural networks involved in training with these technologies. This study was intended to detect the brain network involved in the visual processing of movement during robotic training. The main aim was to investigate the existence of a common cerebral network able to assimilate biological (human upper limb) and non-biological (abstract object) movements, hence testing the suitability of the visual non-biological feedback provided by the InMotion2 Robot.\nMethods: A visual functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) task was administered to 22 healthy subjects. The task required observation and retrieval of motor gestures and of the visual feedback used in robotic training. Functional activations of both biological and non-biological movements were examined to identify areas activated in both conditions, along with differential activity in upper limb vs. abstract object trials. Control of response was also tested by administering trials with congruent and incongruent reaching movements.\nResults: The observation of upper limb and abstract object movements elicited similar patterns of activations according to a caudo-rostral pathway for the visual processing of movements (including specific areas of the occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes). Similarly, overlapping activations were found for the subsequent retrieval of the observed movement. Furthermore, activations of frontal cortical areas were associated with congruent trials more than with the incongruent ones.\nConclusions: This study identified the neural pathway associated with visual processing of movement stimuli used in upper limb robot-mediated training and investigated the brain's ability to assimilate abstract object movements with human motor gestures. In both conditions, activations were elicited in cerebral areas involved in visual perception, sensory integration, recognition of movement, re-mapping on the somatosensory and motor cortex, storage in memory, and response control. Results from the congruent vs. incongruent trials revealed greater activity for the former condition than the latter in a network including cingulate cortex, right inferior and middle frontal gyrus that are involved in the go-signal and in decision control. Results on healthy subjects would suggest the appropriateness of an abstract visual feedback provided during motor training. The task contributes to highlight the potential of fMRI in improving the understanding of visual motor processes and may also be useful in detecting brain reorganisation during training."

    "title": "When Less Is More - Discrete Tactile Feedback Dominates Continuous Audio Biofeedback in the Integrated Percept While Controlling a Myoelectric Prosthetic Hand",
    "abstract": "State of the art myoelectric hand prostheses can restore some feedforward motor function to their users, but they cannot yet restore sensory feedback. It has been shown, using psychophysical tests, that multi-modal sensory feedback is readily used in the formation of the users' representation of the control task in their central nervous system - their internal model. Hence, to fully describe the effect of providing feedback to prosthesis users, not only should functional outcomes be assessed, but so should the internal model. In this study, we compare the complex interactions between two different feedback types, as well as a combination of the two, on the internal model, and the functional performance of naïve participants without limb difference. We show that adding complementary audio biofeedback to visual feedback enables the development of a significantly stronger internal model for controlling a myoelectric hand compared to visual feedback alone, but adding discrete vibrotactile feedback to vision does not. Both types of feedback, however, improved the functional grasping abilities to a similar degree. Contrary to our expectations, when both types of feedback are combined, the discrete vibrotactile feedback seems to dominate the continuous audio feedback. This finding indicates that simply adding sensory information may not necessarily enhance the formation of the internal model in the short term. In fact, it could even degrade it. These results support our argument that assessment of the internal model is crucial to understanding the effects of any type of feedback, although we cannot be sure that the metrics used here describe the internal model exhaustively. Furthermore, all the feedback types tested herein have been proven to provide significant functional benefits to the participants using a myoelectrically controlled robotic hand. This article, therefore, proposes a crucial conceptual and methodological addition to the evaluation of sensory feedback for upper limb prostheses - the internal model - as well as new types of feedback that promise to significantly and considerably improve functional prosthesis control."

    "abstract": "Background: We examined the validity and reliability of a short robotic test of upper limb proprioception, the Arm Movement Detection (AMD) test, which yields a ratio-scaled, objective outcome measure to be used for evaluating the impact of sensory deficits on impairments of motor control, motor adaptation and functional recovery in stroke survivors.\nMethods: Subjects grasped the handle of a horizontal planar robot, with their arm and the robot hidden from view. The robot applied graded force perturbations, which produced small displacements of the handle. The AMD test required subjects to respond verbally to queries regarding whether or not they detected arm motions. Each participant completed ten, 60s trials; in five of the trials, force perturbations were increased in small increments until the participant detected motion while in the others, perturbations were decreased until the participant could no longer detect motion. The mean and standard deviation of the 10 movement detection thresholds were used to compute a Proprioceptive Acuity Score (PAS). Based on the sensitivity and consistency of the estimated thresholds, the PAS quantifies the likelihood that proprioception is intact. Lower PAS scores correspond to higher proprioceptive acuity. Thirty-nine participants completed the AMD test, consisting of 25 neurologically intact control participants (NIC), seven survivors of stroke with intact proprioception in the more affected limb (HSS+P), and seven survivors of stroke with impaired or absent proprioception in the more affected limb (HSS-P).\nResults: Significant group differences were found, with the NIC and HSS+P groups having lower (i.e., better) PAS scores than the HSS-P group. A subset of the participants completed the AMD test multiple times and the AMD test was found to be reliable across repetitions.\nConclusions: The AMD test required less than 15 min to complete and provided an objective, ratio-scaled measure of proprioceptive acuity in the upper limb. In the future, this test could be utilized to evaluate the contributions of sensory deficits to motor recovery following stroke."

    "abstract": "One of the challenges facing prosthetic designers and engineers is to restore the missing sensory function inherit to hand amputation. Several different techniques can be employed to provide amputees with sensory feedback: sensory substitution methods where the recorded stimulus is not only transferred to the amputee, but also translated to a different modality (modality-matched feedback), which transfers the stimulus without translation and direct neural stimulation, which interacts directly with peripheral afferent nerves. This paper presents an overview of the principal works and devices employed to provide upper limb amputees with sensory feedback. The focus is on sensory substitution and modality matched feedback; the principal features, advantages and disadvantages of the different methods are presented."

    "title": "Developing Non-Somatotopic Phantom Finger Sensation to Comparable Levels of Somatotopic Sensation through User Training With Electrotactile Stimulation",
    "abstract": "Cutaneous electrical stimulation can provide tactile feedback for upper-limb amputees through somatotopic feedback (SF) or non-somatotopic feedback (NF). The SF delivers electrotactile stimulus to projection finger maps (PFMs) on the stumps of amputees, which outperforms NF that transfers stimulus to other human intact skin areas in general. However, the SF areas on stumps are very limited and often occupied by electromyography (EMG) sensors in application of myoelectric prosthesis. This work aims at improving NF performance on human upper arms through user training with electrotactile stimulation. The experiments were conducted over seven consecutive days on nine able-bodied subjects and two forearm amputees. The performance measures of NF/SF included the correct identification rates (CIRs), the response time and the NASA-TLX questionnaire. The between-day CIR s on NF sites increased logarithmically with a mean course of 3-day rapid-improving phase and plateaued in the relative-steady phase. The response time and NASA-TLX scores could also rapidly reduce to the comparable levels of the SF areas during the same mean period of 3-day rapid-improving phase, respectively. These results indicated that the performance of NF could be highly improved to the equivalent level as that of SF through 3-day electrotactile training, which we named as \"3-day effect\". It provides important insights that intact skin areas without phantom sensations can effectively replace SF sites to transfer tactile feedback after continuous user training, which validates effectiveness of non-invasive interfaces of tactile feedback for upper-limb amputees in practice."

    "title": "A Novel Flexible Sensor for Muscle Shape Change Monitoring in Limb Motion Recognition",
    "abstract": "Human limb movement intent recognition fundamentally provides the control mechanism for assistive devices such as exoskeleton and limb prosthesis. While different biopotential signals have been utilized for limb movement intent decoding, they seldom could account for spatial information associated with changes in muscle shape that could also be used to characterize the limb motor intent. Therefore, this study developed a novel nano gold stretchable-flexible sensor that captures spatial information associated with the muscle shape change signal (MSCS) during different muscle activation patterns. The novel sensor consists of 2-channels to acquire MSCS at a sampling rate of 125 Hz, corresponding to multiple classes of upper limb movements acquired across six able-bodied subjects. By utilizing the linear discriminant analysis algorithm on the acquired data with a single extracted feature, an overall average motion decoding accuracy of 90.9% was achieved. In addition, the waveform analysis results show that the novel sensor's recordings were less affected by external interferences, thus yielding high quality signals. This study is the first to utilize nano gold stretchable-flexible material for sensor fabrication in pattern recognition of upper limb movement intent, which may facilitate the development of effective assistive devices."

Understanding the feasibility and efficacy of stroke rehabilitation technologies for upper limb impairments is crucial for effective implementation in practice. Small studies have explored views of RT by people with stroke; however experiences of people receiving tDCS in combination with RT have never been explored. Objective To explore views and experiences of people with sub-acute and chronic stroke that had previously taken part in a randomised controlled trial involving tDCS and RT for their impaired upper limb. Methods An interview study includes open and closed questions. Face-to-face interviews were audio recorded. Open-ended question responses were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis; closed questions were analyzed using descriptive analysis. Results Participants felt that RT was enjoyable (90%) and beneficial for their affected arm (100%). From the open question data, it was found that the intervention was effective for the impaired arm especially in the sub-acute stage. Main reported concerns were that tDCS caused painful, itching and burning sensations and RT was sometimes tiring and difficult. Participants recommended that future research should focus on designing a more comfortable method of tDCS and develop a robot that promotes hand movements. Conclusions This study provides new knowledge about the benefits and barriers associated with these technologies which are crucial to the future effective implementation of these tools in practice."

    "abstract": "The development of advanced and effective human-machine interfaces, especially for amputees to control their prostheses, is very high priority and a very active area of research. An intuitive control method should retain an adequate level of functionality for dexterous operation, provide robustness against confounding factors, and supply adaptability for diverse long-term usage, all of which are current problems being tackled by researchers. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art, as well as, the limitations of current myoelectric signal control (MSC) methods. To address the research topic on functionality, we review different approaches to prosthetic hand control (DOF configuration, discrete or simultaneous, etc.), and how well the control is performed (accuracy, response, intuitiveness, etc.). To address the research on robustness, we review the confounding factors (limb positions, electrode shift, force variance, and inadvertent activity) that affect the stability of the control performance. Lastly, to address adaptability, we review the strategies that can automatically adjust the classifier for different individuals and for long-term usage. This review provides a thorough overview of the current MSC methods and helps highlight the current areas of research focus and resulting clinic usability for the MSC methods for upper-limb prostheses."

Rehabilitation robotics have shown promise in improving arm function, but current systems do not allow realistic training of activities of daily living. We have incorporated the ARMin III and HandSOME device into a novel robotic therapy modality that provides functional training of reach and grasp tasks.\nObjective: To compare the effects of equal doses of robotic and conventional therapy in individuals with chronic stroke.\nMethods: Subjects were randomized to 12 hours of robotic or conventional therapy and then crossed over to the other therapy type after a 1-month washout period. Twelve moderate to severely impaired individuals with chronic stroke were enrolled, and 10 completed the study.\nResults: Across the 3-month study period, subjects showed significant improvements in the Fugl-Meyer (P = .013) and Box and Blocks tests (P = .028). The robotic intervention produced significantly greater improvements in the Action Research Arm Test than conventional therapy (P = .033). Gains in the Box and Blocks test from conventional therapy were larger than from robotic therapy in subjects who received conventional therapy after robotic therapy (P = .044).\nConclusions: Data suggest that robotic therapy can elicit improvements in arm function that are distinct from conventional therapy and supplements conventional methods to improve outcomes. Results from this pilot study should be confirmed in a larger study."

    "abstract": "Today neurological diseases such as stroke represent one of the leading cause of long-term disability. Many research efforts have been focused on designing new and effective rehabilitation strategies. In particular, robotic treatment for upper limb stroke rehabilitation has received significant attention due to its ability to provide high-intensity and repetitive movement therapy with less effort than traditional methods. In addition, the development of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has also demonstrated the capability of modulating brain excitability thus increasing motor performance. The combination of these two methods is expected to enhance functional and motor recovery after stroke; to this purpose, the current trends in this research field are presented and discussed through an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art. The heterogeneity and the restricted number of collected studies make difficult to perform a systematic review. However, the literature analysis of the published data seems to demonstrate that the association of tDCS with robotic training has the same clinical gain derived from robotic therapy alone. Future studies should investigate combined approach tailored to the individual patient's characteristics, critically evaluating the brain areas to be targeted and the induced functional changes."

    "title": "Investigation of Fatigability during Repetitive Robot-Mediated Arm Training in People with Multiple Sclerosis",
    "abstract": "Background: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are encouraged to engage in exercise programs but an increased experience of fatigue may impede sustained participation in training sessions. A high number of movements is, however, needed for obtaining optimal improvements after rehabilitation.\nMethods: This cross-sectional study investigated whether people with MS show abnormal fatigability during a robot-mediated upper limb movement trial. Sixteen people with MS and sixteen healthy controls performed five times three minutes of repetitive shoulder anteflexion movements. Movement performance, maximal strength, subjective upper limb fatigue and surface electromyography (median frequency and root mean square of the amplitude of the electromyography (EMG) signal of the anterior deltoid) were recorded during or in-between these exercises. After fifteen minutes of rest, one extra movement bout was performed to investigate how rest influences performance.\nResults: A fifteen minutes upper limb movement protocol increased the perceived upper limb fatigue and induced muscle fatigue, given a decline in maximal anteflexion strength and changes of both the amplitude and the median frequency of EMG the anterior deltoid. In contrast, performance during the 3 minutes of anteflexion movements did not decline. There was no relation between changes in subjective fatigue and the changes in the amplitude and the median frequency of the anterior deltoid muscle, however, there was a correlation between the changes in subjective fatigue and changes in strength in people with MS. People with MS with upper limb weakness report more fatigue due to the repetitive movements, than people with MS with normal upper limb strength, who are comparable to healthy controls. The weak group could, however, keep up performance during the 15 minutes of repetitive movements.\nDiscussion and conclusion: Albeit a protocol of repetitive shoulder anteflexion movements did not elicit a performance decline, fatigue feelings clearly increased in both healthy controls and people with MS, with the largest increase in people with MS with upper limb weakness. Objective fatigability was present in both groups with a decline in the muscle strength and increase of muscle fatigue, shown by changes in the EMG parameters. However, although weak people with multiple sclerosis experienced more fatigue, the objective signs of fatigability were less obvious in weak people with MS, perhaps because this subgroup has central limiting factors, which influence performance from the start of the movements."

To do that, surface electromyography (EMG) signals were monitored with and without a robotic upper-limb exoskeleton for 10 subjects during a drilling task, a typical tedious maintenance or industrial task.

    "abstract": "This study is aimed at assessing of a robot intervention in a task-based upper-arm rehabilitation procedure. Robotic devices have significantly been useful to help therapists do the training procedure. However, due to the lack of quantifiable feedback regarding the level of intervention, effectiveness of various parameters, such as timing, intensity, etc., the training and its efficacy varies remarkably between institution and therapists. In this study, Universal Robot 5 (UR5) has been utilized to move an arm of healthy subjects over a circular path while the muscle activities are recorded through surface electromyography (sEMG); at the same time, all components of the forces applied to the robot have also been measured using Robotiq force sensors (FT300 sensor). System identification (SI) is performed to relate the amount of force in the UR5 to the level of muscle activity in the upper-arm through model. This model has been identified through the data obtained from four healthy subjects, and has been tested and verified with data from a fifth subject. In order to visualize the robot intervention and its efficacy, muscle activities have also been recorded while the subjects perform the task with no robot assistance. The data from this test setting have shown a good agreement in terms of signal profile which suggests robot has not introduced any complications in terms of force or stiffness to the subjects. This preliminary study provides an insight for data driven intervention procedure while robots are used in facilitating the muscle recruitment to complete the desired rehabilitation task, as some patients may not complete the task properly due to muscle weakness in a certain direction and location."

    "title": "Objective Assessment of Spasticity With a Method Based on a Human Upper Limb Model",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a method based on a human upper limb model that assesses the severity of spasticity in patients with stroke objectively. The kinematic model consists of four moving segments connected by four joints. The joint torques are computed using inverse dynamics with measurements from three inertial measurement units (IMUs) attached to the participant's upper limb. The muscle activations are estimated using the joint torques via a musculoskeletal model which consists of 22 muscles. The severity of spasticity is then quantified by measuring the tonic stretch reflex threshold (TSRT) of the participant. 15 patient participants participated in the experiments where they were assessed by two qualified therapists using modified Ashworth scale (MAS), and their motions and EMG signals were captured at the same time. Using the upper limb model, the TSRT of each patient was measured and ranked. The estimated muscle activation profiles have a high correlation (0.707) to the EMG signal profiles. The null hypothesis that the rankings of the severity using the model and the MAS assessment have no correlation has been tested, and was rejected convincingly ( ). These findings suggest that the model has the potential to complement the existing practices by providing an alternative evaluation method."

    "title": "Closed-Loop Continuous Hand Control via Chronic Recording of Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interfaces",
    "abstract": "Loss of the upper limb imposes a devastating interruption to everyday life. Full restoration of natural arm control requires the ability to simultaneously control multiple degrees of freedom of the prosthetic arm and maintain that control over an extended period of time. Current clinically available myoelectric prostheses do not provide simultaneous control or consistency for transradial amputees. To address this issue, we have implemented a standard Kalman filter for continuous hand control using intramuscular electromyography (EMG) from both regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (RPNI) and an intact muscle within non-human primates. Seven RPNIs and one intact muscle were implanted with indwelling bipolar intramuscular electrodes in two rhesus macaques. Following recuperations, function-specific EMG signals were recorded and then fed through the Kalman filter during a hand-movement behavioral task to continuously predict the monkey's finger position. We were able to reconstruct continuous finger movement offline with an average correlation of and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.12 between actual and predicted position from two macaques. This finger movement prediction was also performed in real time to enable closed-loop neural control of a virtual hand. Compared with physical hand control, neural control performance was slightly slower but maintained an average target hit success rate of 96.70%. Recalibration longevity measurements maintained consistent average correlation over time but had a significant change in RMSE ( ). Additionally, extracted single units varied in amplitude by a factor of +18.65% and -25.85% compared with its mean. This is the first demonstration of chronic indwelling electrodes being used for continuous position control via the Kalman filter. Combining these analyses with our novel peripheral nerve interface, we believe that this demonstrates an important step in providing patients with more naturalistic control of their prosthetic limbs."

    "abstract": "Background: Arms are important for locomotor stability and preventing falls by controlling whole-body angular momentum, redirecting the body's center of mass, and providing support to arrest descent. Hence, upper limb loss (ULL) can increase fall risk. However, the prevalence of falls and factors that influence fall risk have not previously been reported for people with ULL.\nObjective: This study quantified fall prevalence in persons with ULL at or proximal to the wrist and identified clinical factors that contributed to the likelihood of falling.\nDesign: This was a cross-sectional study.\nMethods: Factors including body and health characteristics, activity level, fall history, prosthesis use, and balance confidence were determined for persons with ULL proximal to the wrist using an online survey. Logistic regression analyses assessed the contribution of these factors to the classification of fallers (≥2 falls in previous year) and nonfallers.\nResults: A percentage (28.6%) of participants (n = 105) reported experiencing 2 or more falls in the past year. The regression model (R2 = 0.473) correctly classified 84.5% of cases and indicated that increased likelihood of falling was significantly influenced by reduced balance confidence, use of upper limb prostheses, and reduced physical capabilities.\nLimitations: Data were collected online from a convenience sample, and fall classification was based on retrospective data.\nConclusions: Falls in persons with ULL are prevalent, suggesting that clinicians should use screening methods to identify at-risk individuals. Balance confidence, use of upper limb prostheses, and perceived physical capabilities could be useful screening metrics. Research is warranted to better understand the factors that underlie fall risk in persons with ULL and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions capable of mitigating fall risk."

The decoder was controlled by muscles of the forearm or upper arm depending on the level of limb loss. We compare performance using a pair of surface electromyography sensors and while using a data driven weighting of eight sensors. Performance rates demonstrate that amputee participants are able to learn the myoelectric task. Results trend strongly toward enhanced performance when using multiple spatially weighted sensors. Further studies are required to test whether the use of additional myoelectric sensing hardware in abstract decoding would lead to effective prosthesis control."

    "abstract": "Variations in handgrip force influences shoulder muscle activity, and this effect is dependent upon upper limb position. Previous work suggests that neural coupling between proximal and distal muscles with changes in joint position is a possible mechanism but these studies tend to use artificially constrained postures that do not reflect activities of daily living. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of upper limb posture on corticospinal excitability to the forearm muscles during workplace relevant arm positions. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were elicited in four forearm muscles via transcranial magnetic stimulation at six arm positions (45°, 90° and 120° of humeral elevation in both the flexion and abduction planes). MEPs were delivered as stimulus-response curves (SRCs) at rest and at constant intensity during two gripping tasks. Boltzmann plateau levels were smaller for the flexor carpi radialis in flexion at 45° versus 90° (p=0.0008). Extensor carpi radialis had a greater plateau during flexion than abduction (p=0.0042). Corticospinal excitability to the forearm muscles were influenced by upper limb posture during both the resting and gripping conditions. This provides further evidence that upper limb movements are controlled as a whole rather than segmentally and is relevant for workplace design considerations."

EXplaining PLastICITy after stroke (acronym EXPLICIT-stroke) aims to explore the underlying mechanisms of post stroke upper limb recovery. Two randomized single blinded trials form the core of the programme, investigating the effects of early modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (modified CIMT) and EMG-triggered Neuro-Muscular Stimulation (EMG-NMS) in patients with respectively a favourable or poor probability for recovery of dexterity.\nMethods/design: 180 participants suffering from an acute, first-ever ischemic stroke will be recruited. Functional prognosis at the end of the first week post stroke is used to stratify patient into a poor prognosis group for upper limb recovery (N = 120, A2 project) and a group with a favourable prognosis (N = 60, A1 project). Both groups will be randomized to an experimental arm receiving respectively modified CIMT (favourable prognosis) or EMG-NMS (poor prognosis) for 3 weeks or to a control arm receiving usual care. Primary outcome variable will be the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), assessed at 1,2,3,4,5, 8, 12 and 26 weeks post stroke. To study the impact of modified CIMT or EMG-NMS on stroke recovery mechanisms i.e. neuroplasticity, compensatory movements and upper limb neuromechanics, 60 patients randomly selected from projects A1 and A2 will undergo TMS, kinematical and haptic robotic measurements within a repeated measurement design. Additionally, 30 patients from the A1 project will undergo fMRI at baseline, 5 and 26 weeks post stroke.\nConclusion: EXPLICIT stroke is a 5 year translational research programme which main aim is to investigate the effects of early applied intensive intervention for regaining dexterity and to explore the underlying mechanisms that are involved in regaining upper limb function after stroke. EXPLICIT-stroke will provide an answer to the key question whether therapy induced improvements are due to either a reduction of basic motor impairment by neural repair i.e. restitution of function and/or the use of behavioural compensation strategies i.e. substitution of function."

To address this challenge, DEKA developed prototype foot controls. Although the concept of utilizing foot controls to operate an upper limb prosthesis has been discussed for decades, only small-sized studies have been performed and no commercial product exists. The purpose of this paper is to report amputee user perspectives on using three different iterations of foot controls to operate the DEKA Arm.\nMethod: Qualitative data was collected from 36 subjects as part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Study to Optimize the DEKA Arm through surveys, interviews, audio memos, and videotaped sessions. Three major, interrelated themes were identified using the constant comparative method: attitudes towards foot controls, psychomotor learning and physical experience of using foot controls.\nResults: Feedback about foot controls was generally positive for all iterations. The final version of foot controls was viewed most favorably.\nConclusions: Our findings indicate that foot controls are a viable control option that can enable control of a multifunction upper limb prosthesis (the DEKA Arm).\nImplications for rehabilitation: Multifunction upper limb prostheses require many user control inputs to operate. Foot controls offer additional control input options for such advanced devices, yet have had minimal study. This study found that foot controls were a viable option for controlling multifunction upper limb prostheses. Most of the 36 subjects in this study were willing to adopt foot controls to control the multiple degrees of freedom of the DEKA Arm. With training and practice, all users were able to develop the psychomotor skills needed to successfully operate food controls. Some had initial difficulty, but acclimated over time."

However, a major difficulty for the practical application of the BCI to stroke survivors is that the brain rhythms that encode the motor states might be diminished due to the lesion. This study investigates the continuous decoding of natural attempt to move the paralyzed upper limb in stroke survivors from electroencephalographic signals of the unaffected contralesional motor cortex.\nResults: Experiments were carried out with the aid of six severely affected chronic stroke patients performing/attempting self-selected reaching movements of the unaffected/affected upper limb. The electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis showed significant cortical activation on the uninjured motor cortex when moving the contralateral unaffected arm and in the attempt to move the ipsilateral affected arm. Using this activity, significant continuous decoding of movement was obtained in six out of six participants in movements of the unaffected limb, and in four out of six participants in the attempt to move the affected limb.\nConclusion: This study showed that it is possible to construct a decoder of the attempt to move the paretic arm for chronic stroke patients using the EEG activity of the healthy contralesional motor cortex.\nSignificance: This decoding model could provide to stroke survivors with a natural, easy, and intuitive way to achieve control of BCIs or robot-assisted rehabilitation devices."

    "title": "Resolving the adverse impact of mobility on myoelectric pattern recognition in upper-limb multifunctional prostheses",
    "abstract": "Electromyogram pattern recognition (EMG-PR) based control for upper-limb prostheses conventionally focuses on the classification of signals acquired in a controlled laboratory setting. In such a setting, relatively stable and high performances are often reported because subjects could consistently perform muscle contractions corresponding to a targeted limb motion. Meanwhile the clinical implementation of EMG-PR method is characterized by degradations in stability and classification performances due to the disparities between the constrained laboratory setting and clinical use. One of such disparities is the mobility of subject that would cause changes in the EMG signal patterns when eliciting identical limb motions in mobile scenarios. In this study, the effect of mobility on the performance of EMG-PR motion classifier was firstly investigated based on myoelectric and accelerometer signals acquired from six upper-limb amputees across four scenarios. Secondly, three methods were proposed to mitigate such effect on the EMG-PR motion classifier. From the obtained results, an average classification error (CE) of 9.50% (intra-scenario) was achieved when data from the same scenarios were used to train and test the EMG-PR classifier, while the CE increased to 18.48% (inter-scenario) when trained and tested with dataset from different scenarios. This implies that mobility would significantly lead to about 8.98% increase of classification error (p < 0.05). By applying the proposed methods, the degradation in classification performance was significantly reduced from 8.98% to 1.86% (Dual-stage sequential method), 3.17% (Hybrid strategy), and 4.64% (Multi-scenario strategy). Hence, the proposed methods may potentially improve the clinical robustness of the currently available multifunctional prostheses.\nTrial registration: The study was approved by the ethics committee of Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, and the reference number is SIAT-IRB-150515-H0077."

    "abstract": "In robotic rehabilitation, knowledge of human joint torques is very important to provide reliable data for clinical assessment and to provide feedback information about the user in order to design safe robotic control strategies. Nevertheless, their measurement can be complex and requires a high-cost implementation. Estimation approaches based on disturbance observers have been well studied for human joint torque estimation in robotic rehabilitation systems, most of them, for upper-limb devices. This paper represents our initial effort toward applying disturbance observer techniques for estimation of patient torque for lower-limb robotic rehabilitation. Three disturbance observer approaches for torque estimation are evaluated on a test scenario consisting of a robotic wearable device for ankle rehabilitation attached to a physical mock-up that replicates the ankle movement in the sagittal plane. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methods and encourage us to test them with voluntary users."

    "title": "Feedforward model based arm weight compensation with the rehabilitation robot ARMin",
    "abstract": "Highly impaired stroke patients at early stages of recovery are unable to generate enough muscle force to lift the weight of their own arm. Accordingly, task-related training is strongly limited or even impossible. However, as soon as partial or full arm weight support is provided, patients are enabled to perform arm rehabilitation training again throughout an increased workspace. In the literature, the current solutions for providing arm weight support are mostly mechanical. These systems have components that restrict the freedom of movement or entail additional disturbances. A scalable weight compensation for upper and lower arm that is online adjustable as well as generalizable to any robotic system is necessary. In this paper, a model-based feedforward weight compensation of upper and lower arm fulfilling these requirements is introduced. The proposed method is tested with the upper extremity rehabilitation robot ARMin V, but can be applied in any other actuated exoskeleton system. Experimental results were verified using EMG measurements. These results revealed that the proposed weight compensation reduces the effort of the subjects to 26% on average and more importantly throughout the entire workspace of the robot."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, electric-powered hand prostheses do not provide adequate sensory instrumentation and artificial feedback to allow users voluntarily and finely modulate the grasp strength applied to the objects. In this work, the design of a control architecture for a myocontrol-based regulation of the grasp strength for a robotic hand equipped with contact force sensors is presented. The goal of the study was to provide the user with the capability of modulating the grasping force according to target required levels by exploiting a vibrotactile feedback. In particular, the whole human-robot control system is concerned (i.e. myocontrol, robotic hand controller, vibrotactile feedback.) In order to evaluate the intuitiveness and force tracking performance provided by the proposed control architecture, an experiment was carried out involving four naïve able-bodied subjects in a grasping strength regulation task with a myocontrolled robotic hand (the University of Bologna Hand), requiring for grasping different objects with specific target force levels. The reported results show that the control architecture successfully allowed all subjects to achieve all grasping strength levels exploiting the vibrotactile feedback information. This preliminary demonstrates that, potentially, the proposed control interface can be profitably exploited in upper-limb prosthetic applications, as well as for non-rehabilitation uses, e.g. in ultra-light teleoperation for grasping devices."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Current training for laparoscopy focuses only on the enhancement of manual skill and does not give advice on improving trainees' posture. However, a poor posture can result in increased static muscle loading, faster fatigue, and impaired psychomotor task performance. In this paper, the authors propose a method, named subliminal persuasion, which gives the trainee real-time advice for correcting the upper limb posture during laparoscopic training like the expert but leads to a lower increment in the workload.\nMethods: A 9-axis inertial measurement unit was used to compute the upper limb posture, and a Detection Reaction Time device was developed and used to measure the workload. A monitor displayed not only images from laparoscope, but also a visual stimulus, a transparent red cross superimposed to the laparoscopic images, when the trainee had incorrect upper limb posture. One group was exposed, when their posture was not correct during training, to a short (about 33 ms) subliminal visual stimulus. The control group instead was exposed to longer (about 660 ms) supraliminal visual stimuli.\nResults: We found that subliminal visual stimulation is a valid method to improve trainees' upper limb posture during laparoscopic training. Moreover, the additional workload required for subconscious processing of subliminal visual stimuli is less than the one required for supraliminal visual stimuli, which is processed instead at the conscious level.\nConclusions: We propose subliminal persuasion as a method to give subconscious real-time stimuli to improve upper limb posture during laparoscopic training. Its effectiveness and efficiency were confirmed against supraliminal stimuli transmitted at the conscious level: Subliminal persuasion improved upper limb posture of trainees, with a smaller increase on the overall workload."

    "title": "Neural coupling between upper and lower limbs during recumbent stepping",
    "abstract": "During gait rehabilitation, therapists or robotic devices often supply physical assistance to a patient's lower limbs to aid stepping. The expensive equipment and intensive manual labor required for these therapies limit their availability to patients. One alternative solution is to design devices where patients could use their upper limbs to provide physical assistance to their lower limbs (i.e., self-assistance). To explore potential neural effects of coupling upper and lower limbs, we investigated neuromuscular recruitment during self-driven and externally driven lower limb motion. Healthy subjects exercised on a recumbent stepper using different combinations of upper and lower limb exertions. The recumbent stepper mechanically coupled the upper and lower limbs, allowing users to drive the stepping motion with upper and/or lower limbs. We instructed subjects to step with 1) active upper and lower limbs at an easy resistance level (active arms and legs); 2) active upper limbs and relaxed lower limbs at easy, medium, and hard resistance levels (self-driven); and 3) relaxed upper and lower limbs while another person drove the stepping motion (externally driven). We recorded surface electromyography (EMG) from six lower limb muscles. Self-driven EMG amplitudes were always higher than externally driven EMG amplitudes (P < 0.05). As resistance and upper limb exertion increased, self-driven EMG amplitudes also increased. EMG bursts during self-driven and active arms and legs stepping occurred at similar times. These results indicate that active upper limb movement increases neuromuscular activation of the lower limbs during cyclic stepping motions. Neurologically impaired humans that actively engage their upper limbs during gait rehabilitation may increase neuromuscular activation and enhance activity-dependent plasticity."

    "title": "Somatotopical feedback versus non-somatotopical feedback for phantom digit sensation on amputees using electrotactile stimulation",
    "abstract": "Background: Transcutaneous electrical stimulation can provide amputees with tactile feedback for better manipulating an advanced prosthesis. In general, there are two ways to transfer the stimulus to the skin: somatotopical feedback (SF) that stimulates the phantom digit somatotopy on the stump and non-somatotopical feedback (NF) that stimulates other positions on the human body.\nMethods: To investigate the difference between SF and NF, electrotactile experiments were conducted on seven amputees. Electrical stimulation was applied via a complete phantom map to the residual limb (SF) and to the upper arm (NF) separately. The behavior results of discrimination accuracy and response time were used to examine: 1) performance differences between SF and NF for discriminating position, type and strength of tactile feedback; 2) performance differences between SF and NF for one channel (1C), three channels (3C), and five channels (5C). NASA-TLX standardized testing was used to determine differences in mental workload between SF and NF.\nResults: The grand-averaged discrimination accuracy for SF was 6% higher than NF, and the average response time for SF was 600 ms faster than NF. SF is better than NF for position, type, strength, and the overall modality regarding both accuracy and response time except for 1C modality (p<0.001). Among the six modalities of stimulation channels, performance of 1C/SF was the best, which was similar to that of 1C/NF and 3C/SF; performance of 3C/NF was similar to that of 5C/SF; performance of 5C/NF was the worst. NASA-TLX scores indicated that mental workload increased as the number of stimulation channels increased.\nConclusions: We quantified the difference between SF and NF, and the influence of different number of stimulation channels. SF was better than NF in general, but the practical issues such as the limited area of stumps could constrain the use of SF. We found that more channels increased the amount and richness of information to the amputee while fewer channels resulted in higher performance, and thus the 3C/SF modality was a good compromise. Based on this study, we provide possible solutions to the practical problems involving the implementation of tactile feedback for amputees. These results are expected to promote the application of SF and NF tactile feedback for amputees in the future."

In this study, electrotactile and auditive error-based feedback, only giving feedback when an undesired event occurs, were tested for its use in upper-leg prosthesis when provided during a perturbation.\nTechnique: A total of nine healthy subjects walked on a prosthetic simulator which was disturbed at the end of the swing phase. They received either no feedback, electrotactile feedback, or auditive feedback at the time of the perturbation.\nDiscussion: The reaction time of the subjects only improved by 40 ms when using auditory feedback, compared to the no-feedback condition. No changes in reaction time were found in the electrotactile feedback condition. Considering perturbation detection was not taken into account in this study, this improvement is not enough for practical applications in upper-leg prosthesis.\nClinical relevance: Many transfemoral amputees are insecure about their prosthesis, are afraid of falling, or actually fall. Providing feedback specifically during a perturbation may prevent them from falling, or at least give them a chance to react."

We developed and tested online ten able-bodied subjects in a semi-supervised method to achieve simultaneous, continuous control of two DOFs of a robotic arm, using muscle synergies extracted from upper limb muscles while performing flexion-extension movements of the elbow and shoulder joints in the horizontal plane. To validate the efficacy of the synergy-based approach in extracting reliable control signals, compared to the simple muscle-pair method typically used in commercial applications, we evaluated the repeatability of the algorithm over days, the effect of the arm dynamics on the control performance, and the robustness of the control scheme to the presence of co-contraction between pairs of antagonist muscles. Results showed that, without the need for a daily calibration, all subjects were able to intuitively and easily control the synergy-based myoelectric interface in different scenarios, using both dynamic and isometric muscle contractions. The proposed control scheme was shown to be robust to co-contraction between antagonist muscles, providing better performance compared to the traditional muscle-pair approach. The current study is a first step toward user-friendly application of synergy-based myocontrol of assistive robotic devices."

Various approaches have been investigated for tactile feedback, ranging from direct neural stimulation to noninvasive sensory substitution methods. However, only a few of studies evaluated the closed-loop performance, and real-time movement information of active prostheses still could not be transferred in the form of proprioceptive feedback so far. In current study, an integrated closed-loop prosthesis system consisted of two types of sensors, programmable electrical stimulator and multichannel array electrodes was presented. The grasping angle and corresponding grasping force of the single-freedom myoelectric prosthesis were simultaneously coded with spatial and mixed (spatial and intensity of sensation) coding scheme and tested in 15 able-bodied subjects. The experimental results demonstrated that the subjects were able to discriminate 4 types of object sizes, 3 kinds of different softness and 4 levels of grasping forces in relatively high correct identification rates (CIRs) (size: 87.5%, Softness: 94%, grasping force: 73.8%).

A currently active research line seeking to maximize upper-limb motor recovery after a brain injury, deals with the combined use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) and mechanical supporting devices, in what has been previously termed hybrid robotic systems. This study evaluates from the technical and clinical perspectives the usability of an integrated hybrid robotic system for the rehabilitation of upper-limb reaching movements after a brain lesion affecting the motor function.\nMethods: The presented system is comprised of four main components. The hybrid assistance is given by a passive exoskeleton to support the arm weight against gravity and a functional electrical stimulation device to assist the execution of the reaching task. The feedback error learning (FEL) controller was implemented to adjust the intensity of the electrical stimuli delivered on target muscles according to the performance of the users. This control strategy is based on a proportional-integral-derivative feedback controller and an artificial neural network as the feedforward controller. Two experiments were carried out in this evaluation. First, the technical viability and the performance of the implemented FEL controller was evaluated in healthy subjects (N = 12). Second, a small cohort of patients with a brain injury (N = 4) participated in two experimental session to evaluate the system performance. Also, the overall satisfaction and emotional response of the users after they used the system was assessed.\nResults: In the experiment with healthy subjects, a significant reduction of the tracking error was found during the execution of reaching movements. In the experiment with patients, a decreasing trend of the error trajectory was found together with an increasing trend in the task performance as the movement was repeated. Brain injury patients expressed a great acceptance in using the system as a rehabilitation tool.\nConclusions: The study demonstrates the technical feasibility of using the hybrid robotic system for reaching rehabilitation. Patients' reports on the received intervention reveal a great satisfaction and acceptance of the hybrid robotic system.\nTrial registration: Retrospective trial registration in ISRCTN Register with study ID ISRCTN12843006 ."

    "abstract": "The first decade and a half of the twenty-first century brought about two major innovations in neuroprosthetics: the development of anthropomorphic robotic limbs that replicate much of the function of a native human arm and the refinement of algorithms that decode intended movements from brain activity. However, skilled manipulation of objects requires somatosensory feedback, for which vision is a poor substitute. For upper-limb neuroprostheses to be clinically viable, they must therefore provide for the restoration of touch and proprioception. In this review, I discuss efforts to elicit meaningful tactile sensations through stimulation of neurons in somatosensory cortex. I focus on biomimetic approaches to sensory restoration, which leverage our current understanding about how information about grasped objects is encoded in the brain of intact individuals. I argue that not only can sensory neuroscience inform the development of sensory neuroprostheses, but also that the converse is true: stimulating the brain offers an exceptional opportunity to causally interrogate neural circuits and test hypotheses about natural neural coding."

    "abstract": "While robot-assisted arm and hand training after stroke allows for intensive task-oriented practice, it has provided only limited additional benefit over dose-matched physiotherapy up to now. These rehabilitation devices are possibly too supportive during the exercises. Neurophysiological signals might be one way of avoiding slacking and providing robotic support only when the brain is particularly responsive to peripheral input. We tested the feasibility of three-dimensional robotic assistance for reaching movements with a multi-joint exoskeleton during motor imagery (MI)-related desynchronization of sensorimotor oscillations in the β-band. We also registered task-related network changes of cortical functional connectivity by electroencephalography via the imaginary part of the coherence function. Healthy subjects and stroke survivors showed similar patterns-but different aptitudes-of controlling the robotic movement. All participants in this pilot study with nine healthy subjects and two stroke patients achieved their maximum performance during the early stages of the task. Robotic control was significantly higher and less variable when proprioceptive feedback was provided in addition to visual feedback, i.e., when the orthosis was actually attached to the subject's arm during the task. A distributed cortical network of task-related coherent activity in the θ-band showed significant differences between healthy subjects and stroke patients as well as between early and late periods of the task. Brain-robot interfaces (BRIs) may successfully link three-dimensional robotic training to the participants' efforts and allow for task-oriented practice of activities of daily living with a physiologically controlled multi-joint exoskeleton. Changes of cortical physiology during the task might also help to make subject-specific adjustments of task difficulty and guide adjunct interventions to facilitate motor learning for functional restoration, a proposal that warrants further investigation in a larger cohort of stroke patients."

    "abstract": "Background: To assist people with disabilities, exoskeletons must be provided with human-robot interfaces and smart algorithms capable to identify the user's movement intentions. Surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals could be suitable for this purpose, but their applicability in shared control schemes for real-time operation of assistive devices in daily-life activities is limited due to high inter-subject variability, which requires custom calibrations and training. Here, we developed a machine-learning-based algorithm for detecting the user's motion intention based on electromyographic signals, and discussed its applicability for controlling an upper-limb exoskeleton for people with severe arm disabilities.\nMethods: Ten healthy participants, sitting in front of a screen while wearing the exoskeleton, were asked to perform several reaching movements toward three LEDs, presented in a random order. EMG signals from seven upper-limb muscles were recorded. Data were analyzed offline and used to develop an algorithm that identifies the onset of the movement across two different events: moving from a resting position toward the LED (Go-forward), and going back to resting position (Go-backward). A set of subject-independent time-domain EMG features was selected according to information theory and their probability distributions corresponding to rest and movement phases were modeled by means of a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The detection of movement onset by two types of detectors was tested: the first type based on features extracted from single muscles, whereas the second from multiple muscles. Their performances in terms of sensitivity, specificity and latency were assessed for the two events with a leave one-subject out test method.\nResults: The onset of movement was detected with a maximum sensitivity of 89.3% for Go-forward and 60.9% for Go-backward events. Best performances in terms of specificity were 96.2 and 94.3% respectively. For both events the algorithm was able to detect the onset before the actual movement, while computational load was compatible with real-time applications.\nConclusions: The detection performances and the low computational load make the proposed algorithm promising for the control of upper-limb exoskeletons in real-time applications. Fast initial calibration makes it also suitable for helping people with severe arm disabilities in performing assisted functional tasks."

    "abstract": "Paralysis following spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other disorders can disconnect the brain from the body, eliminating the ability to perform volitional movements. A neural interface system could restore mobility and independence for people with paralysis by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices. We have previously shown that people with long-standing tetraplegia can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices. Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm, but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity paralysis or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions. Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing tetraplegia to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements. Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex (MI) neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array. One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5 years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle. Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with tetraplegia, years after injury to the central nervous system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals."

    "abstract": "Background: Replantation of traumatic upper arm amputations are usually contraindicated due to patient age, comorbid diseases, ischemia time, and/or avulsion of proximal structures. Stable soft tissue coverage preserving proximal stump length and critical joints is required to prevent loss of limb function and aid in prosthetic fitting and comfort. The use of free fillet flaps from the amputated limb is well documented for lower-extremity amputations but has only recently been reported for upper-arm amputations involving distal humeral or elbow wounds or following radical upper-arm tumor resections. Furthermore, these described free fillet flaps were fasciocutaneous rather than composite flaps. Composite free fillet flaps from the amputated upper arm utilizing the flexor muscles adjacent to the vascular pedicles is not well described or documented.\nMethods: Eight upper-extremity, composite, free fillet flaps were performed to cover proximal humeral and shoulder defects secondary to upper-arm traumatic amputation from July 1995 to May 2005 on 7 males and 1 female. A retrospective chart review was completed, and information collected included the age of patient, gender, date of injury and surgery, amputation site, mechanism of injury, ischemia time, type of fillet flap, donor and recipient vessels, flap sensation, flap survival, and number of complications.\nResults: All upper-arm amputations were trauma related (100%) and secondary to industrial accidents (4), motor vehicle and motorcycle accidents (2), fall (1), and train (1). Patient age ranged from 16 to 62 years and polytrauma was noted in 50%. Procedures included 6 composite free fillet flaps and 2 radial forearm free fillet flaps, with 4 (50%) sensate. Sensory nerves included the medial (3) and lateral (2) antebrachial cutaneous nerves attached to median proximal nerve stumps. Ischemia time ranged from 280 to 630 minutes. All flaps survived and 2 (25%) complications occurred in 1 patient. Subjective and protective sensation was observed in each neurorrhaphy; however, no confirmatory tested was used.\nConclusion: Immediate soft tissue coverage using composite free fillet flaps from amputated limbs can be successful, with few complications, and preserves limb length while maximizing available tissue. Furthermore, including flexor muscle belly adjacent to the vascular pedicles provides additional coverage and a well-vascularized composite flap to aid in prosthetic fitting and comfort."

    "abstract": "Non-invasive sensory feedback is a desirable goal for upper limb prostheses as well as in human robot interaction and other human machine interfaces. Yet many approaches have been studied, none has been broadly deployed in upper limb prostheses. Bone conduction has the potential to excite an effect known as osseoperception and therefore provides a novel sensory interface. This paper presents the preliminary results of our study into the temporal parameters of a sensory feedback interface utilizing vibrotactile stimulus onto the ulnar olecranon representing a non-invasive sensory feedback interface. Three different tests are performed to establish the characterizing parameters of the interface; perception threshold, sensation discrimination and reaction time. Our results are similar to the results obtained for invasive bone conduction. The perception threshold for lower frequencies is small and therefore allows using small transducers with low power consumption. The sensation discrimination shows comparable results as reported in existing literature as well as the reaction time for the amputee is within the same range."

    "title": "Fascicular Topography of the Human Median Nerve for Neuroprosthetic Surgery",
    "abstract": "One of the most sought-after applications of neuroengineering is the communication between the arm and an artificial prosthetic device for the replacement of an amputated hand or the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries. For that, an electrode is placed around or inside the median nerve to serve as interface for recording and stimulation of nerve signals coming from the fascicles that innervate the muscles responsible for hand movements. Due to the lack of a standard procedure, the electrode implantation by the surgeon is strongly based on intuition, which may result in poor performance of the neuroprosthesis because of the suboptimal location of the neural interface. To provide morphological data that can aid the neuroprosthetic surgeon with this procedure, we investigated the fascicular topography of the human median nerve along the forearm and upper arm. We first performed a description of the fascicular content and branching patterns along the length of the arm. Next we built a 3D reconstruction of the median nerve so we could analyze the fascicle morphological features in relation to the arm level. Finally, we characterized the motor content of the median nerve fascicles in the upper arm. Collectively, these results indicate that fascicular organization occurs in a short segment distal to the epicondyles and remains unaltered until the muscular branches leave the main trunk. Based on our results, overall recommendations based on electrode type and implant location can be drawn to help and aid the neuroprosthetic procedure. Invasive interfaces would be more convenient for the upper arm and the most proximal third of the forearm. Epineural electrodes seem to be most suitable for the forearm segment after fascicles have been divided from the main trunk."

Dual-task assignments present competition for visual attention and may affect the performance of ADLs. Vibrotactile feedback (VTF) is a frequently-used method to provide prosthesis users with tactile feedback. However, the effect of adding VTF on visual attention and performance in a motor dual-task paradigm has not been investigated. Our aim was to compare visual attention and performance during ADLs in a motor dual-task paradigm when using binary VTF and without using VTF. Forty-three able-bodied subjects (age 26 ± 6.6 years) had a myoelectric-controlled hand attached to their right hand. The dual task comprised of a computer game played with the left hand, while manipulating objects with the artificial hand. This was performed with and without VTF in a counter-balanced order of two conditions. An eye-tracker monitored visual attention, while time to complete each task and the time the virtual car went off-road were recorded. No significant differences were found in visual attention or in performance time between the two conditions. Further examination of adding VTF to prosthesis users is recommended, with disrupted visual feedback and basic grasping tasks."

Signal fusion is a possible approach to solve the problem of insufficient control commands, where some non-EMG signals are combined with sEMG signals to provide sufficient information for motion intension decoding. In this study, a motion-classification method that combines sEMG and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were proposed and investigated, in order to improve the control performance of upper-limb prostheses.\nMethods: Four transhumeral amputees without any form of neurological disease were recruited in the experiments. Five motion classes including hand-open, hand-close, wrist-pronation, wrist-supination, and no-movement were specified. During the motion performances, sEMG and EEG signals were simultaneously acquired from the skin surface and scalp of the amputees, respectively. The two types of signals were independently preprocessed and then combined as a parallel control input. Four time-domain features were extracted and fed into a classifier trained by the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm for motion recognition. In addition, channel selections were performed by using the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) algorithm to optimize the performance of the proposed method.\nResults: The classification performance achieved by the fusion of sEMG and EEG signals was significantly better than that obtained by single signal source of either sEMG or EEG. An increment of more than 14% in classification accuracy was achieved when using a combination of 32-channel sEMG and 64-channel EEG. Furthermore, based on the SFS algorithm, two optimized electrode arrangements (10-channel sEMG + 10-channel EEG, 10-channel sEMG + 20-channel EEG) were obtained with classification accuracies of 84.2 and 87.0%, respectively, which were about 7.2 and 10% higher than the accuracy by using only 32-channel sEMG input.\nConclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of fusing sEMG and EEG signals towards improving motion classification accuracy for above-elbow amputees, which might enhance the control performances of multifunctional myoelectric prostheses in clinical application.\nTrial registration: The study was approved by the ethics committee of Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, and the reference number is SIAT-IRB-150515-H0077."

    "abstract": "Background: Severe orbital soft-tissue loss and contracted eye sockets often present in patients who have had enucleation, exenteration, or other ocular diseases. In this article, the authors report a novel contracted eye socket reconstruction technique using lateral upper arm free flaps and review the surgical outcome in patients with severe orbital soft-tissue loss and contracted eye sockets.\nMethods: Twenty-four patients with severe orbital soft-tissue loss and contracted eye sockets were included in this study. A free flap from the lateral upper arm of the patient was inserted into the eye socket, with the artery and vein of the flap pedicle attached to the ipsilateral superficial temporal artery and vein, respectively. Eye socket reconstruction was performed 2 weeks after the first operation. Patients were fitted with a piece of prosthesis 3 months later. Most patients needed a second operation for eyelid and eye socket reconstruction, including lower eyelid laxity and retraction correction, medial and lateral canthoplasty, and upper or lower fornix reconstruction.\nResults: Postoperative improvement in appearance was evaluated, including texture and color of the flaps, sensation and mobility of the forearm and elbow, and visibility of the surgical scar. All 24 patients were followed up for 6 months to 5 years. Donor sites healed with linear scars, and no sensory or movement loss was found in any of the patients. The reconstructed area appeared good, patients were satisfied with recovering results, and the prosthesis fit well.\nConclusions: The skin from the lateral upper arm has consistent blood vessels and suitable thickness to serve as a source for orbital soft-tissue and contracted eye socket reconstruction, with good cosmetic outcomes.\nClinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV."

    "title": "The efficacy of SMART Arm training early after stroke for stroke survivors with severe upper limb disability: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial",
    "abstract": "Background: Recovery of upper limb function after stroke is poor. The acute to subacute phase after stroke is the optimal time window to promote the recovery of upper limb function. The dose and content of training provided conventionally during this phase is however, unlikely to be adequate to drive functional recovery, especially in the presence of severe motor disability. The current study concerns an approach to address this shortcoming, through evaluation of the SMART Arm, a non-robotic device that enables intensive and repetitive practice of reaching by stroke survivors with severe upper limb disability, with the aim of improving upper limb function. The outcomes of SMART Arm training with or without outcome-triggered electrical stimulation (OT-stim) to augment movement and usual therapy will be compared to usual therapy alone.\nMethods/design: A prospective, assessor-blinded parallel, three-group randomised controlled trial is being conducted. Seventy-five participants with a first-ever unilateral stroke less than 4 months previously, who present with severe arm disability (three or fewer out of a possible six points on the Motor Assessment Scale [MAS] Item 6), will be recruited from inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three dose-matched groups: SMART Arm training with OT-stim and usual therapy; SMART Arm training without OT-stim and usual therapy; or usual therapy alone. All participants will receive 20 hours of upper limb training over four weeks. Blinded assessors will conduct four assessments: pre intervention (0-weeks), post intervention (4-weeks), 26 weeks and 52 weeks follow-up. The primary outcome measure is MAS item 6. All analyses will be based on an intention-to-treat principle.\nDiscussion: By enabling intensive and repetitive practice of a functional upper limb task during inpatient rehabilitation, SMART Arm training with or without OT-stim in combination with usual therapy, has the potential to improve recovery of upper limb function in those with severe motor disability. The immediate and long-term effects of SMART Arm training on upper limb impairment, activity and participation will be explored, in addition to the benefit of training with or without OT-stim to augment movement when compared to usual therapy alone.\nTrial registration: ACTRN12608000457347."

    "title": "Role of Muscle Synergies in Real-Time Classification of Upper Limb Motions using Extreme Learning Machines",
    "abstract": "Background: Myoelectric signals offer significant insights in interpreting the motion intention and extent of effort involved in performing a movement, with application in prostheses, orthosis and exoskeletons. Feature extraction plays a vital role, and follows two approaches: EMG and synergy features. More recently, muscle synergy based features are being increasingly explored, since it simplifies dimensionality of control, and are considered to be more robust to signal variations. Another important aspect in a myoelectrically controlled devices is the learning capability and speed of performance for online decoding. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a relatively new neural-network based learning algorithm: its performance hasn't been explored in the context of online control, which is a more reliable measure compared to offline analysis. To this purpose we aim at focusing our investigation on a myoelectric-based interface which is able to identify and online classify, upper limb motions involving shoulder and elbow. The main objective is to compare the performance of the decoder trained using ELM, for two different features: EMG and synergy features.\nMethods: The experiments are broadly divided in two phases training/calibration and testing respectively. ELM is used to train the decoder using data acquired during the calibration phase. The performance of the decoder is then tested in online motion control by using a simulated graphical user interface replicating the human limb: subjects are requested to control a virtual arm by using their muscular activity. The decoder performance is quantified using ad-hoc metrics based on the following indicators: motion selection time, motion completion time, and classification accuracy.\nResults: Performance has been evaluated for both offline and online contexts. The offline classification results indicated better performance in the case of EMG features, whereas a better classification accuracy for synergy feature was observed for online decoding. Also the other indicators as motion selection time and motion completion time, showed better trend in the case of synergy than time-domain features.\nConclusion: This work demonstrates better robustness of online decoding of upper-limb motions and motor intentions when using synergy feature. Furthermore, we have quantified the performance of the decoder trained using ELM for online control, providing a potential and viable option for real-time myoelectric control in assistive technology."

    "title": "Psychometric characterization of incidental feedback sources during grasping with a hand prosthesis",
    "abstract": "Background: A prosthetic system should ideally reinstate the bidirectional communication between the user's brain and its end effector by restoring both motor and sensory functions lost after an amputation. However, current commercial prostheses generally do not incorporate somatosensory feedback. Even without explicit feedback, grasping using a prosthesis partly relies on sensory information. Indeed, the prosthesis operation is characterized by visual and sound cues that could be exploited by the user to estimate the prosthesis state. However, the quality of this incidental feedback has not been objectively evaluated.\nMethods: In this study, the psychometric properties of the auditory and visual feedback of prosthesis motion were assessed and compared to that of a vibro-tactile interface. Twelve able-bodied subjects passively observed prosthesis closing and grasping an object, and they were asked to discriminate (experiment I) or estimate (experiment II) the closing velocity of the prosthesis using visual (VIS), acoustic (SND), or combined (VIS + SND) feedback. In experiment II, the subjects performed the task also with a vibrotactile stimulus (VIB) delivered using a single tactor. The outcome measures for the discrimination and estimation experiments were just noticeable difference (JND) and median absolute estimation error (MAE), respectively.\nResults: The results demonstrated that the incidental sources provided a remarkably good discrimination and estimation of the closing velocity, significantly outperforming the vibrotactile feedback. Using incidental sources, the subjects could discriminate almost the minimum possible increment/decrement in velocity that could be commanded to the prosthesis (median JND < 2% for SND and VIS + SND). Similarly, the median MAE in estimating the prosthesis velocity randomly commanded from the full working range was also low, i.e., approximately 5% in SND and VIS + SND.\nConclusions: Since the closing velocity is proportional to grasping force in state-of-the-art myoelectric prostheses, the results of the present study imply that the incidental feedback, when available, could be usefully exploited for grasping force control. Therefore, the impact of incidental feedback needs to be considered when designing a feedback interface in prosthetics, especially since the quality of estimation using supplemental sources (e.g., vibration) can be worse compared to that of the intrinsic cues."

    "abstract": "Robotic systems that are interfaced with virtual reality gaming and task simulations are increasingly being developed to provide repetitive intensive practice to promote increased compliance and facilitate better outcomes in rehabilitation post-stroke. A major development in the use of virtual environments (VEs) has been to incorporate tactile information and interaction forces into what was previously an essentially visual experience. Robots of varying complexity are being interfaced with more traditional virtual presentations to provide haptic feedback that enriches the sensory experience and adds physical task parameters. This provides forces that produce biomechanical and neuromuscular interactions with the VE that approximate real-world movement more accurately than visual-only VEs, simulating the weight and force found in upper extremity tasks. The purpose of this article is to present an overview of several systems that are commercially available for ambulation training and for training movement of the upper extremity. We will also report on the system that we have developed (NJIT-RAVR system) that incorporates motivating and challenging haptic feedback effects into VE simulations to facilitate motor recovery of the upper extremity post-stroke. The NJIT-RAVR system trains both the upper arm and the hand. The robotic arm acts as an interface between the participants and the VEs, enabling multiplanar movements against gravity in a three-dimensional workspace. The ultimate question is whether this medium can provide a motivating, challenging, gaming experience with dramatically decreased physical difficulty levels, which would allow for participation by an obese person and facilitate greater adherence to exercise regimes."

    "title": "Evaluating the Effectiveness and Safety of the Electroencephalogram-Based Brain-Machine Interface Rehabilitation System for Patients With Severe Hemiparetic Stroke: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial (BEST-BRAIN Trial)",
    "abstract": "Background: We developed a brain-machine interface (BMI) system for poststroke patients with severe hemiplegia to detect event-related desynchronization (ERD) on scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and to operate a motor-driven hand orthosis combined with neuromuscular electrical stimulation. ERD arises when the excitability of the ipsi-lesional sensorimotor cortex increases.\nObjective: The aim of this study was to evaluate our hypothesis that motor training using this BMI system could improve severe hemiparesis that is resistant to improvement by conventional rehabilitation. We, therefore, planned and implemented a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intensive rehabilitation using the BMI system.\nMethods: We conducted a single blind, multicenter RCT and recruited chronic poststroke patients with severe hemiparesis more than 90 days after onset (N=40). Participants were randomly allocated to the BMI group (n=20) or the control group (n=20). Patients in the BMI group repeated 10-second motor attempts to operate EEG-BMI 40 min every day followed by 40 min of conventional occupational therapy. The interventions were repeated 10 times in 2 weeks. Control participants performed a simple motor imagery without servo-action of the orthosis, and electrostimulation was given for 10 seconds for 40 min, similar to the BMI intervention. Overall, 40 min of conventional occupational therapy was also given every day after the control intervention, which was also repeated 10 times in 2 weeks. Motor functions and electrophysiological phenotypes of the paretic hands were characterized before (baseline), immediately after (post), and 4 weeks after (follow-up) the intervention. Improvement in the upper extremity score of the Fugl-Meyer assessment between baseline and follow-up was the main outcome of this study.\nResults: Recruitment started in March 2017 and ended in July 2018. This trial is currently in the data correcting phase. This RCT is expected to be completed by October 31, 2018.\nConclusions: No widely accepted intervention has been established to improve finger function of chronic poststroke patients with severe hemiparesis. The results of this study will provide clinical data for regulatory approval and novel, important understanding of the role of sensory-motor feedback based on BMI to induce neural plasticity and motor recovery.\nTrial registration: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000026372; https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr_e/ctr_view.cgi? recptno=R000030299 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/743zBJj3D).\nInternational registered report identifier (irrid): DERR1-10.2196/12339."

    "title": "Key considerations in designing a somatosensory neuroprosthesis",
    "abstract": "In recent years, a consensus has emerged that somatosensory feedback needs to be provided for upper limb neuroprostheses to be useful. An increasingly promising approach to sensory restoration is to electrically stimulate neurons along the somatosensory neuraxis to convey information about the state of the prosthetic limb and about contact with objects. To date, efforts toward artificial sensory feedback have consisted mainly of demonstrating that some sensory information could be conveyed using a small number of stimulation patterns, generally delivered through single electrodes. However impressive these achievements are, results from different studies are hard to compare, as each research team implements different stimulation patterns and tests the elicited sensations differently. A critical question is whether different stimulation strategies will generalize from contrived laboratory settings to activities of daily living. Here, we lay out some key specifications that an artificial somatosensory channel should meet, discuss how different approaches should be evaluated, and caution about looming challenges that the field of sensory restoration will face."

    "title": "A composite robotic-based measure of upper limb proprioception",
    "abstract": "Background: Proprioception is the sense of the position and movement of our limbs, and is vital for executing coordinated movements. Proprioceptive disorders are common following stroke, but clinical tests for measuring impairments in proprioception are simple ordinal scales that are unreliable and relatively crude. We developed and validated specific kinematic parameters to quantify proprioception and compared two common metrics, Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances, to combine these parameters into an overall summary score of proprioception.\nMethods: We used the KINARM robotic exoskeleton to assess proprioception of the upper limb in subjects with stroke (N = 285. Mean days post-stroke = 12 ± 15). Two aspects of proprioception (position sense and kinesthetic sense) were tested using two mirror-matching tasks without vision. The tasks produced 12 parameters to quantify position sense and eight to quantify kinesthesia. The Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances of the z-scores for these parameters were computed each for position sense, kinesthetic sense, and overall proprioceptive function (average score of position and kinesthetic sense).\nResults: A high proportion of stroke subjects were impaired on position matching (57%), kinesthetic matching (65%), and overall proprioception (62%). Robotic tasks were significantly correlated with clinical measures of upper extremity proprioception, motor impairment, and overall functional independence. Composite scores derived from the Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance showed strong content validity as they were highly correlated (r = 0.97-0.99).\nConclusions: We have outlined a composite measure of upper extremity proprioception to provide a single continuous outcome measure of proprioceptive function for use in clinical trials of rehabilitation. Multiple aspects of proprioception including sense of position, direction, speed, and amplitude of movement were incorporated into this measure. Despite similarities in the scores obtained with these two distance metrics, the Mahalanobis distance was preferred."

    "title": "Performance-based robotic assistance during rhythmic arm exercises",
    "abstract": "Background: Rhythmic and discrete upper-limb movements are two fundamental motor primitives controlled by different neural pathways, at least partially. After stroke, both primitives can be impaired. Both conventional and robot-assisted therapies mainly train discrete functional movements like reaching and grasping. However, if the movements form two distinct neural and functional primitives, both should be trained to recover the complete motor repertoire. Recent studies show that rhythmic movements tend to be less impaired than discrete ones, so combining both movement types in therapy could support the execution of movements with a higher degree of impairment by movements that are performed more stably.\nMethods: A new performance-based assistance method was developed to train rhythmic movements with a rehabilitation robot. The algorithm uses the assist-as-needed paradigm by independently assessing and assisting movement features of smoothness, velocity, and amplitude. The method relies on different building blocks: (i) an adaptive oscillator captures the main movement harmonic in state variables, (ii) custom metrics measure the movement performance regarding the three features, and (iii) adaptive forces assist the patient. The patient is encouraged to improve performance regarding these three features with assistance forces computed in parallel to each other. The method was tested with simulated jerky signals and a pilot experiment with two stroke patients, who were instructed to make circular movements with an end-effector robot with assistance during half of the trials.\nResults: Simulation data reveal sensitivity of the metrics for assessing the features while limiting interference between them. The assistance's effectiveness with stroke patients is established since it (i) adapts to the patient's real-time performance, (ii) improves patient motor performance, and (iii) does not lead the patient to slack. The smoothness assistance was by far the most used by both patients, while it provided no active mechanical work to the patient on average.\nConclusion: Our performance-based assistance method for training rhythmic movements is a viable candidate to complement robot-assisted upper-limb therapies for training a larger motor repertoire."

    "title": "Blending of brain-machine interface and vision-guided autonomous robotics improves neuroprosthetic arm performance during grasping",
    "abstract": "Background: Recent studies have shown that brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) offer great potential for restoring upper limb function. However, grasping objects is a complicated task and the signals extracted from the brain may not always be capable of driving these movements reliably. Vision-guided robotic assistance is one possible way to improve BMI performance. We describe a method of shared control where the user controls a prosthetic arm using a BMI and receives assistance with positioning the hand when it approaches an object.\nMethods: Two human subjects with tetraplegia used a robotic arm to complete object transport tasks with and without shared control. The shared control system was designed to provide a balance between BMI-derived intention and computer assistance. An autonomous robotic grasping system identified and tracked objects and defined stable grasp positions for these objects. The system identified when the user intended to interact with an object based on the BMI-controlled movements of the robotic arm. Using shared control, BMI controlled movements and autonomous grasping commands were blended to ensure secure grasps.\nResults: Both subjects were more successful on object transfer tasks when using shared control compared to BMI control alone. Movements made using shared control were more accurate, more efficient, and less difficult. One participant attempted a task with multiple objects and successfully lifted one of two closely spaced objects in 92 % of trials, demonstrating the potential for users to accurately execute their intention while using shared control.\nConclusions: Integration of BMI control with vision-guided robotic assistance led to improved performance on object transfer tasks. Providing assistance while maintaining generalizability will make BMI systems more attractive to potential users.\nTrial registration: NCT01364480 and NCT01894802 ."

    "title": "A neural tracking and motor control approach to improve rehabilitation of upper limb movements",
    "abstract": "Background: Restoration of upper limb movements in subjects recovering from stroke is an essential keystone in rehabilitative practices. Rehabilitation of arm movements, in fact, is usually a far more difficult one as compared to that of lower extremities. For these reasons, researchers are developing new methods and technologies so that the rehabilitative process could be more accurate, rapid and easily accepted by the patient. This paper introduces the proof of concept for a new non-invasive FES-assisted rehabilitation system for the upper limb, called smartFES (sFES), where the electrical stimulation is controlled by a biologically inspired neural inverse dynamics model, fed by the kinematic information associated with the execution of a planar goal-oriented movement. More specifically, this work details two steps of the proposed system: an ad hoc markerless motion analysis algorithm for the estimation of kinematics, and a neural controller that drives a synthetic arm. The vision of the entire system is to acquire kinematics from the analysis of video sequences during planar arm movements and to use it together with a neural inverse dynamics model able to provide the patient with the electrical stimulation patterns needed to perform the movement with the assisted limb.\nMethods: The markerless motion tracking system aims at localizing and monitoring the arm movement by tracking its silhouette. It uses a specifically designed motion estimation method, that we named Neural Snakes, which predicts the arm contour deformation as a first step for a silhouette extraction algorithm. The starting and ending points of the arm movement feed an Artificial Neural Controller, enclosing the muscular Hill's model, which solves the inverse dynamics to obtain the FES patterns needed to move a simulated arm from the starting point to the desired point. Both position error with respect to the requested arm trajectory and comparison between curvature factors have been calculated in order to determine the accuracy of the system.\nResults: The proposed method has been tested on real data acquired during the execution of planar goal-oriented arm movements. Main results concern the capability of the system to accurately recreate the movement task by providing a synthetic arm model with the stimulation patterns estimated by the inverse dynamics model. In the simulation of movements with a length of +/- 20 cm, the model has shown an unbiased angular error, and a mean (absolute) position error of about 1.5 cm, thus confirming the ability of the system to reliably drive the model to the desired targets. Moreover, the curvature factors of the factual human movements and of the reconstructed ones are similar, thus encouraging future developments of the system in terms of reproducibility of the desired movements.\nConclusion: A novel FES-assisted rehabilitation system for the upper limb is presented and two parts of it have been designed and tested. The system includes a markerless motion estimation algorithm, and a biologically inspired neural controller that drives a biomechanical arm model and provides the stimulation patterns that, in a future development, could be used to drive a smart Functional Electrical Stimulation system (sFES). The system is envisioned to help in the rehabilitation of post stroke hemiparetic patients, by assisting the movement of the paretic upper limb, once trained with a set of movements performed by the therapist or in virtual reality. Future work will include the application and testing of the stimulation patterns in real conditions."

    "title": "Compensation or Restoration: Closed-Loop Feedback of Movement Quality for Assisted Reach-to-Grasp Exercises with a Multi-Joint Arm Exoskeleton",
    "abstract": "Assistive technology allows for intensive practice and kinematic measurements during rehabilitation exercises. More recent approaches attach a gravity-compensating multi-joint exoskeleton to the upper extremity to facilitate task-oriented training in three-dimensional space with virtual reality feedback. The movement quality, however, is mostly captured through end-point measures that lack information on proximal inter-joint coordination. This limits the differentiation between compensation strategies and genuine restoration both during the exercise and in the course of rehabilitation. We extended in this proof-of-concept study a commercially available seven degree-of-freedom arm exoskeleton by using the real-time sensor data to display a three-dimensional multi-joint visualization of the user's arm. Ten healthy subjects and three severely affected chronic stroke patients performed reach-to-grasp exercises resembling activities of daily living assisted by the attached exoskeleton and received closed-loop online feedback of the three-dimensional movement in virtual reality. Patients in this pilot study differed significantly with regard to motor performance (accuracy, temporal efficiency, range of motion) and movement quality (proximal inter-joint coordination) from the healthy control group. In the course of 20 training and feedback sessions over 4 weeks, these pathological measures improved significantly toward the reference parameters of healthy participants. It was moreover feasible to capture the evolution of movement pattern kinematics of the shoulder and elbow and to quantify the individual degree of natural movement restoration for each patient. The virtual reality visualization and closed-loop feedback of joint-specific movement kinematics makes it possible to detect compensation strategies and may provide a tool to achieve the rehabilitation goals in accordance with the individual capacity for genuine functional restoration; a proposal that warrants further investigation in controlled studies with a larger cohort of stroke patients."

    "abstract": "Therapies using functional electrical stimulation (FES) in conjunction with practice of everyday tasks have proven effective in facilitating recovery of upper limb function following stroke. The aim of the current study is to develop a multi-channel electrical stimulation system that precisely controls the assistance provided in goal-orientated tasks through use of advanced model-based 'iterative learning control' (ILC) algorithms to facilitate functional motor recovery of the upper limb post-stroke. FES was applied to three muscle groups in the upper limb (the anterior deltoid, triceps and wrist extensors) to assist hemiparetic, chronic stroke participants to perform a series of functional tasks with real objects, including closing a drawer, turning on a light switch and repositioning an object. Position data from the participants' impaired upper limb was collected using a Microsoft Kinect® and was compared to an ideal reference. ILC used data from previous attempts at the task to moderate the FES signals applied to each muscle group on a trial by trial basis to reduce performance error whilst supporting voluntary effort by the participant. The clinical trial is on-going. Preliminary results show improvements in performance accuracy for each muscle group, as well as improvements in clinical outcome measures pre and post 18 training sessions. Thus, the feasibility of applying precisely controlled FES to three muscle groups in the upper limb to facilitate functional reach and grasp movements post stroke has been demonstrated."

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggested that both robot-assisted rehabilitation and non-invasive brain stimulation can produce a slight improvement in severe chronic stroke patients. It is still unknown whether their combination can produce synergistic and more consistent improvements. Safety and efficacy of this combination has been assessed within a proof-of-principle, double-blinded, semi-randomized, sham-controlled trial. Inhibitory continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS) was delivered on the affected hemisphere, in order to improve the response to the following robot-assisted therapy via a homeostatic increase of learning capacity. Twenty severe upper limb-impaired chronic stroke patients were randomized to robot-assisted therapy associated with real or sham cTBS, delivered for 10 working days. Eight real and nine sham patients completed the study. Change in Fugl-Meyer was chosen as primary outcome, while changes in several quantitative indicators of motor performance extracted by the robot as secondary outcomes. The treatment was well-tolerated by the patients and there were no adverse events. All patients achieved a small, but significant, Fugl-Meyer improvement (about 5%). The difference between the real and the sham cTBS groups was not significant. Among several secondary end points, only the Success Rate (percentage of targets reached by the patient) improved more in the real than in the sham cTBS group. This study shows that a short intensive robot-assisted rehabilitation produces a slight improvement in severe upper-limb impaired, even years after the stroke. The association with homeostatic metaplasticity-promoting non-invasive brain stimulation does not augment the clinical gain in patients with severe stroke."

    "abstract": "Modern rehabilitation practices have begun integrating robots, recognizing their significant role in recovery. New and alternative stroke rehabilitation treatments are essential to enhance efficacy and mitigate associated health costs. Today's robotic interventions can play a significant role in advancing rehabilitation. In addition, robots have an inherent ability to perform tasks accurately and reliably and are typically well suited to measure and quantify performance. Most rehabilitation strategies predominantly target activation of the paretic arm. However, bimanual upper-limb rehabilitation research suggests potential in enhancing functional recovery. Moreover, studies suggest that limb coordination and synchronization can improve treatment efficacy. In this preliminary study, we aimed to investigate and validate our user-driven bimanual system in a reduced intensity rehab practice. A bimanual wearable robotic device (BWRD) with a Master-Slave configuration for the elbow joint was developed to carry out the investigation. The BWRD incorporates position and force sensors for which respective control loops are implemented, and offers varying modes of operation ranging from passive to active training. The proposed system enables the perception of the movements, as well as the forces applied by the hemiparetic arm, with the non-hemiparetic arm. Eight participants with chronic unilateral stroke were recruited to participate in a total of three 1-h sessions per participant, delivered in a week. Participants underwent pre- and post-training functional assessments along with proprioceptive measures. The post-assessment was performed at the end of the last training session. The protocol was designed to engage the user in an assortment of static and dynamic arm matching and opposing tasks. The training incorporates force-feedback movements, force-feedback positioning, and force matching tasks with same and opposite direction movements. We are able to suggest identification of impairment patterns in the position-force plot results. In addition, we performed a proprioception evaluation with the system. We set out to design innovative and user immersive training tasks that utilize the BWRD capabilities, and we demonstrate that the subjects were able to cooperate and accomplish the protocol. We found that the Fugl-Meyer and Wolf Motor Function Test (pre to post) measured improvements (15 and 19%, respectively). Recognizing the brevity of the training, we focus our report primarily on the proprioception testing (32% significant improvement, p prop = 0.033) and protocol distinctive features and results. This paper presents the electromechanical features and performance of the BWRD, the testing protocol, and the assessments utilized. Outcome measures and results are presented and demonstrate the successful application and operation of the system."

This questionnaire encompassed 41 statements organized around seven key domains: overall satisfaction related to the training program, satisfaction related to the overground robotic exoskeleton, satisfaction related to the program attributes, perceived learnability, perceived health benefits and risks and perceived motivation to engage in physical activity. Each statement was rated using a visual analogue scale ranging from \"0 = totally disagree\" to \"100 = completely agree\".\nResults: Overall, respondents unanimously considered themselves satisfied with the locomotor training program with the robotic exoskeleton (95.7 ± 0.7%) and provided positive feedback about the robotic exoskeleton itself (82.3 ± 6.9%), the attributes of the locomotor training program (84.5 ± 6.9%) and their ability to learn to perform sit-stand transfers and walk with the robotic exoskeleton (79.6 ± 17%). Respondents perceived some health benefits (67.9 ± 16.7%) and have reported no fear of developing secondary complications or of potential risk for themselves linked to the use of the robotic exoskeleton (16.7 ± 8.2%).

All long-term manual wheelchair users with a spinal cord injury who participated in the study predominantly perceived improvements in their overall health status, upper limb strength and endurance as well as in their sleep and psychological well-being upon completion of a 6-8-week locomotor training program with the robotic exoskeleton. All long-term manual wheelchair users with a spinal cord injury who participated in the study unanimously felt motivated to engage in a regular physical activity program adapted to their condition and most of them do plan to continue to participate in moderate-to-strenuous physical exercise. Additional research on clients' perspectives, especially satisfaction with the overground exoskeleton and locomotor training program attributes, is needed."

    "title": "Design, control, and sensory feedback of externally powered hand prostheses: a literature review",
    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a steep rise in the quality of prostheses for patients with upper limb amputations. Researchers have begun to identify methods of making prosthetic hands both functional and cosmetically appealing, in contrast to past designs. Many improvements have occurred because of novel design strategies, such as the use of underactuated mechanisms, which allow for more degrees of freedom (DOF) or help reduce the weight of the prosthesis. The increase in functionality is also due in large part to advancements in control strategies for prosthetic hands. One common control method, using electromyographic (EMG) signals generated by muscle contractions, has allowed for an increase in the DOF of hand designs and a larger number of available grip patterns with little added complexity for the wearer. Another recent improvement in prosthetic hand design instead employs electroneurographic (ENG) signals, requiring an interface directly with the peripheral nervous system (PNS) or the central nervous system (CNS). Despite the recent progress in design and control strategies, however, prosthetic hands are still far more limited than the actual human hand. This review outlines the recent progress in the development of electrode-based prosthetic hands, detailing advancements in the areas of design, sensory feedback, and control through EMG and ENG signals (with a particular focus on interfaces with the PNS). The potential benefits and limitations of both control strategies, in terms of signal classification, invasiveness, and sensory feedback, are discussed. Finally, a brief overview of interfaces with the CNS is provided, and potential future developments for prosthetic hand design are discussed."

    "title": "Training-induced changes in the pattern of triceps to biceps activation during reaching tasks after chronic and severe stroke",
    "abstract": "This exploratory study was undertaken to investigate the mechanisms that contributed to improvements in upper limb function following a novel training program. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to examine training-induced changes in the pattern of triceps and biceps activation during reaching tasks in stroke survivors with severe paresis in the chronic stage of recovery. The EMG data were obtained in the context of a single blind randomised clinical trial conducted with 42 stroke survivors with minimal upper limb muscle activity and who were more than 6 months post-stroke. Of the 33 participants who completed the study, 10 received training of reaching using a non-robotic upper limb training device, the SMART Arm, with EMG triggered functional electrical stimulation (EMG-stim), 13 received training of reaching using the SMART Arm alone, and 10 received no intervention. Each intervention group engaged in 12 1-h training sessions over a 4-week period. Clinical and laboratory measures of upper limb function were administered prior to training (0 weeks), at completion (4 weeks) and 2 months (12 weeks) after training. The primary outcome measure was 'upper arm function' which is Item 6 of the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS). Laboratory measures consisted of two multijoint reaching tasks to assess 'maximum isometric force' and 'maximum distance reached'. Surface EMG was used to monitor triceps brachii and biceps brachii during the two reaching tasks. To provide a comparison with normal values, seven healthy adults were tested on one of the reaching tasks according to the same procedure. Study findings demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in upper limb function for stroke participants in the two training groups compared to those who received no training however no difference was found between the two training groups. For the reaching tasks, all stroke participants, when compared to normal healthy adults, exhibited lower triceps and biceps activation and a lower ratio of triceps to biceps activation. Following training, stroke participants demonstrated increased triceps activation and an increased ratio of triceps to biceps activation for the task that was trained. Better performance was associated with greater triceps activation and a higher ratio of triceps to biceps activation. The findings suggest that increased activation of triceps as an agonist and an improved coordination between triceps and biceps could have mediated the observed changes in arm function. The changes in EMG activity were small relative to the changes in arm function indicating that factors, such as the contribution of other muscles of reaching, may also be implicated."

    "title": "Hybrid Neuroprosthesis for the Upper Limb: Combining Brain-Controlled Neuromuscular Stimulation with a Multi-Joint Arm Exoskeleton",
    "abstract": "Brain-machine interface-controlled (BMI) neurofeedback training aims to modulate cortical physiology and is applied during neurorehabilitation to increase the responsiveness of the brain to subsequent physiotherapy. In a parallel line of research, robotic exoskeletons are used in goal-oriented rehabilitation exercises for patients with severe motor impairment to extend their range of motion (ROM) and the intensity of training. Furthermore, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is applied in neurologically impaired patients to restore muscle strength by closing the sensorimotor loop. In this proof-of-principle study, we explored an integrated approach for providing assistance as needed to amplify the task-related ROM and the movement-related brain modulation during rehabilitation exercises of severely impaired patients. For this purpose, we combined these three approaches (BMI, NMES, and exoskeleton) in an integrated neuroprosthesis and studied the feasibility of this device in seven severely affected chronic stroke patients who performed wrist flexion and extension exercises while receiving feedback via a virtual environment. They were assisted by a gravity-compensating, seven degree-of-freedom exoskeleton which was attached to the paretic arm. NMES was applied to the wrist extensor and flexor muscles during the exercises and was controlled by a hybrid BMI based on both sensorimotor cortical desynchronization (ERD) and electromyography (EMG) activity. The stimulation intensity was individualized for each targeted muscle and remained subthreshold, i.e., induced no overt support. The hybrid BMI controlled the stimulation significantly better than the offline analyzed ERD (p = 0.028) or EMG (p = 0.021) modality alone. Neuromuscular stimulation could be well integrated into the exoskeleton-based training and amplified both the task-related ROM (p = 0.009) and the movement-related brain modulation (p = 0.019). Combining a hybrid BMI with neuromuscular stimulation and antigravity assistance augments upper limb function and brain activity during rehabilitation exercises and may thus provide a novel restorative framework for severely affected stroke patients."

    "title": "A Greedy Assist-as-Needed Controller for Upper Limb Rehabilitation",
    "abstract": "Previous studies on robotic rehabilitation have shown that subjects' active participation and effort involved in rehabilitation training can promote the performance of therapies. In order to improve the voluntary effort of participants during the rehabilitation training, assist-as-needed (AAN) control strategies regulating the robotic assistance according to subjects' performance and conditions have been developed. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of patients' motor function capability in task space is not taken into account during the implementation of these controllers. In this paper, a new scheme called greedy AAN (GAAN) controller is designed for the upper limb rehabilitation training of neurologically impaired subjects. The proposed GAAN control paradigm includes a baseline controller and a Gaussian RBF network that is utilized to model the functional capability of subjects and to provide corresponding a task challenge for them. In order to avoid subjects' slacking and encourage their active engagement, the weight vectors of RBF networks evaluating subjects' impairment level are updated based on a greedy strategy that makes the networks progressively learn the maximum forces over time provided by subjects. Simultaneously, a challenge level modification algorithm is employed to adjust the task challenge according to the task performance of subjects. Experiments on 12 subjects with neurological impairment are conducted to validate the performance and feasibility of the GAAN controller. The results show that the proposed GAAN controller has significant potential to promote the subjects' voluntary engagement during training exercises."

    "abstract": "The aims of this study were to develop and evaluate reliability of a quantitative assessment tool for upper limb sense of position on the horizontal plane. We evaluated 15 healthy individuals (controls) and 9 stroke patients. A robotic device passively moved one arm of the blindfolded participant who had to actively move his/her opposite hand to the mirror location in the workspace. Upper-limb's position was evaluated by a digital camera. The position of the passive hand was compared with the active hand's 'mirror' position. Performance metrics were then computed to measure the mean absolute errors, error variability, spatial contraction/expansion, and systematic shifts. No significant differences were observed between dominant and non-dominant active arms of controls. All performance parameters of the post-stroke group differed significantly from those of controls. This tool can provide a quantitative measure of upper limb sense of position, therefore allowing detection of changes due to rehabilitation."

    "title": "Exploring Self-Paced Embodiable Neurofeedback for Post-stroke Motor Rehabilitation",
    "abstract": "Neurofeedback-guided motor-imagery training (NF-MIT) has been proposed as a promising intervention following upper limb motor impairment. In this intervention, paretic stroke patients receive online feedback about their brain activity while conducting a motor-imagery (MI) task with the paretic limb. Typically, the feedback provided in NF-MIT protocols is an abstract visual signal based on a fixed trial. Here we developed a self-paced NF-MIT paradigm with an embodiable feedback signal (EFS), which was designed to resemble the content of the mental act as closely as possible. To this end, the feedback was delivered via an embodiable, anthropomorphic robotic hand (RH), which was integrated into a closed-looped EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Whenever the BCI identified a new instance of a hand-flexion or hand-extension imagination by the participant, the RH carried out the corresponding movement with minimum delay. Nine stroke patients and nine healthy participants were instructed to control RH movements as accurately as possible, using mental activity alone. We evaluated the general feasibility of our paradigm on electrophysiological, subjective and performance levels. Regarding electrophysiological measures, individuals showed the predicted event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns over sensorimotor brain areas. On the subjective level, we found that most individuals integrated the RH into their body scheme. With respect to RH control, none of our participants achieved a high level of control, but most managed to control the RH actions to some degree. Importantly, patients and controls achieved similar performance levels. The results support the view that self-paced embodiable NF-MIT is feasible for stroke patients and can complement classical NF-MIT."

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerves provide a promising source of motor control signals for neuroprosthetic devices. Unfortunately, the clinical utility of current peripheral nerve interfaces is limited by signal amplitude and stability. Here, we showed that the regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) serves as a biologically stable bioamplifier of efferent motor action potentials with long-term stability in upper limb amputees. Ultrasound assessments of RPNIs revealed prominent contractions during phantom finger flexion, confirming functional reinnervation of the RPNIs in two patients. The RPNIs in two additional patients produced electromyography signals with large signal-to-noise ratios. Using these RPNI signals, subjects successfully controlled a hand prosthesis in real-time up to 300 days without control algorithm recalibration. RPNIs show potential in enhancing prosthesis control for people with upper limb loss."

    "title": "Planar conformity of movements in 3D reaching tasks for persons with Multiple Sclerosis",
    "abstract": "Robotic rehabilitation of the upper limb has been proved beneficial for people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In order to provide task-specific therapy for MS, given its complex impairing nature, it is desired to take advantage of the robots' ability to move and provide force feedback in generic three-dimensional motions. Previous investigations have shown that hand motion during reaching tasks is piecewise planar, therefore, it is possible to simplify the design of robotic rehabilitation trajectories by confining them on planes oriented in space. To do so, it must first be established whether this natural tendency for tracking a plane during hand movement is affected by the presence of neurological impairment, such as Multiple Sclerosis. This work hypothesizes that in the case of people with MS, planar mapping is not dependent on the resulting impairment. Furthermore, it is investigated whether neurophysiological models such as Fitts' law and Minimum Jerk Model remain in effect when considering the plane-mapped trajectories and also how these are affected by MS in contrast to natural movement. To test the hypotheses a group of healthy people and a group of people with MS at various stages of the disease have performed reaching tasks in the context of a haptic-interface based Nine-Hole-Pegboard-Test (NHPT) which facilitates the generation of trajectories with various distances and durations in the three-dimensional space. The results suggest that, despite the neurological impairments, the planar adaptation of people with MS is almost as persistent as in the case of healthy people. Furthermore it is shown that Fitts' law and MJM apply for plane-mapped trajectories and can be utilized in the design of simplified robotic rehabilitation schemes."

    "title": "Proprioceptive Based Training for stroke recovery. Proposal of new treatment modality for rehabilitation of upper limb in neurological diseases",
    "abstract": "Background: The central nervous system (CNS) has plastic properties allowing its adaptation through development. These properties are still maintained in the adult age and potentially activated in case of brain lesion. In the present study authors hypothesized that a significant recovery of voluntary muscle contraction in post stroke patients experiencing severe upper limb paresis can be obtained, when proprioceptive based stimulations are provided. Proprioceptive based training (PBT) is based on performing concurrent movements with both unaffected and affected arm, with the aim to foster motor recovery through some mutual connections of interhemispheric and transcallosal pathways. The aim of this pre-post pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of PBT on recovery of voluntary muscle contraction in subacute phase after stroke.\nMethods: The treatment lasted 1 h daily, 5 days per week for 3 weeks. The PBT consisted of multidirectional exercises executed synchronously with unaffected limb and verbal feedback. The Medical Research Council scale (MRC), Dynamometer, Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity scale (F-M UE), Functional Independence Measure scale (FIM) and modified Ashworth scale were administered at the beginning and at the end of training. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.\nResults: Six patients with severe paresis of the upper limb within 6 months after stroke were enrolled in the study (5 ischemic and 1 hemorrhagic stroke, 3 men and 3 women, mean age 65.7 ± 8.7 years, mean distance from stroke 4.1 ± 1.5 months) and all of them well tolerated the training. The clinical changes of voluntary muscle contraction after PBT were statistically significant at the MRC scale overall (p = 0.028), and dynamometer assessment overall (p = 0.028). Each patient improved muscle contraction of one or more muscles and in 4 out of 6 patients voluntary active movement emerged after therapy. The functional outcomes (i.e. F-M UE and FIM) did not show significant change within group.\nConclusions: The findings of this preliminary research revealed that PBT may be a feasible intervention to improve the motricity of upper limb in stroke survivors."

    "abstract": "The loss of a hand has many psychosocial repercussions. While advanced multi-articulated prostheses can improve function, without sensation, they cannot restore the full experience and connection of a hand. Direct nerve interfaces can restore naturalistic sensation to amputees. Our sensory restoration system produced tactile and proprioceptive sensations on the hand via neural stimulation through chronically implanted electrodes. In this study, upper limb amputees used a sensory-enabled prosthesis in their homes and communities, autonomously and unconstrained to specific tasks. These real-life conditions enabled us to study the impact of sensation on prosthetic usage, functional performance, and psychosocial experience. We found that sensory feedback fundamentally altered the way participants used their prosthesis, transforming it from a sporadically-used tool into a readily and frequently-used hand. Functional performance with sensation improved following extended daily use. Restored sensation improved a wide range of psychosocial factors, including self-efficacy, prosthetic embodiment, self-image, social interaction, and quality of life. This study demonstrates that daily use of a sensory-enabled prosthesis restores the holistic experience of having a hand and more fully reconnects amputees with the world."

The sensor consists of a skin interface, signal conditioning circuitry and power supply unit all encased in a single package. The tuned RC parameters based envelope detection scheme employed in the sensor enables faster as well as reliable recognition of EMG signal patterns regardless of its strength and subject variability. The output performance of the developed sensor was compared with a commercial EMG sensor regarding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), amplitude sensitivity and response time. EMG signals with both the devices were acquired for 10 subjects (three amputees and seven healthy subjects), to perform this comparative analysis. The results showed 4× greater SNR values and 50% higher sensitivity of the developed sensor than the commercial EMG sensor. Also, the proposed sensor was 57% faster than the commercial sensor in producing the output response. The sensor was successfully tested on amputees for controlling a 3D printed hand prototype utilising a proportional control strategy. The enhanced output parameters of the sensor were responsible for smooth, faster and intuitive actuation of the prosthetic hand fingers."

A predictor of functional gains might improve the ability to select those individuals more likely to benefit from robot-based therapy. Studies evaluating predictors of functional improvement after a robotic training are scarce. One study has found that white matter tract integrity predicts functional gains following a robotic training of the hand and wrist. Objective. To determine the predictive ability of behavioral and brain measures in order to improve selection of individuals for robotic training.\nMethods: Twenty subjects with chronic stroke participated in an 8-week course of robotic exoskeletal training for the arm. Before training, a clinical evaluation, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were each measured as predictors. Final functional gain was defined as change in the Box and Block Test (BBT). Measures significant in bivariate analysis were fed into a multivariate linear regression model.\nResults: Training was associated with an average gain of 6 ± 5 blocks on the BBT (P < .0001). Bivariate analysis revealed that lower baseline motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude on TMS, and lower laterality M1 index on fMRI each significantly correlated with greater BBT change. In the multivariate linear regression analysis, baseline MEP magnitude was the only measure that remained significant.\nConclusion: Subjects with lower baseline MEP magnitude benefited the most from robotic training of the affected arm. These subjects might have reserve remaining for the training to boost corticospinal excitability, translating into functional gains."

    "title": "Quantification of task-dependent cortical activation evoked by robotic continuous wrist joint manipulation in chronic hemiparetic stroke",
    "abstract": "Background: Cortical damage after stroke can drastically impair sensory and motor function of the upper limb, affecting the execution of activities of daily living and quality of life. Motor impairment after stroke has been thoroughly studied, however sensory impairment and its relation to movement control has received less attention. Integrity of the somatosensory system is essential for feedback control of human movement, and compromised integrity due to stroke has been linked to sensory impairment.\nMethods: The goal of this study is to assess the integrity of the somatosensory system in individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke with different levels of sensory impairment, through a combination of robotic joint manipulation and high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). A robotic wrist manipulator applied continuous periodic disturbances to the affected limb, providing somatosensory (proprioceptive and tactile) stimulation while challenging task execution. The integrity of the somatosensory system was evaluated during passive and active tasks, defined as 'relaxed wrist' and 'maintaining 20% maximum wrist flexion', respectively. The evoked cortical responses in the EEG were quantified using the power in the averaged responses and their signal-to-noise ratio.\nResults: Thirty individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke and ten unimpaired individuals without stroke participated in this study. Participants with stroke were classified as having severe, mild, or no sensory impairment, based on the Erasmus modification of the Nottingham Sensory Assessment. Under passive conditions, wrist manipulation resulted in contralateral cortical responses in unimpaired and chronic stroke participants with mild and no sensory impairment. In participants with severe sensory impairment the cortical responses were strongly reduced in amplitude, which related to anatomical damage. Under active conditions, participants with mild sensory impairment showed reduced responses compared to the passive condition, whereas unimpaired and chronic stroke participants without sensory impairment did not show this reduction.\nConclusions: Robotic continuous joint manipulation allows studying somatosensory cortical evoked responses during the execution of meaningful upper limb control tasks. Using such an approach it is possible to quantitatively assess the integrity of sensory pathways; in the context of movement control this provides additional information required to develop more effective neurorehabilitation therapies."

The bone-anchor provides a transcutaneous feed-through for muscle signal recording. This approach can be combined with targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) to further improve myoelectric control.\nMethods: A bone-anchored device was implanted trans-tibially in n = 8 sheep with a bipolar recording electrode secured epimysially to the peroneus tertius muscle. TMR was carried out in a single animal: the peroneus tertius was deinnervated and the distal portion of the transected nerve to the peroneus muscle was coapted to a transected nerve branch previously supplying the tibialis anterior muscle. For 12 weeks (TMR) or 19 weeks (standard procedure), epimysial muscle signals were recorded while animals walked at 2 km·h-1.\nResults: After 19 weeks implantation following standard procedure, epimysial recording signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was 18.7 dB (± 6.4 dB, 95% CI) with typical recordings falling in the range 10-25 dB. Recoveries in gait and muscle signals were coincident 6 weeks post-TMR; initial muscle activity was identifiable 3 weeks post-TMR though with low signal amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio compared with normal muscle recordings.\nConclusions: Following recovery, muscle signals were recorded reliably over 19 weeks following implantation. In this study, targeted reinnervation was successful in parallel with bone-anchor implantation, with recovery identified 6 weeks after surgery."

    "title": "Humans can integrate feedback of discrete events in their sensorimotor control of a robotic hand",
    "abstract": "Providing functionally effective sensory feedback to users of prosthetics is a largely unsolved challenge. Traditional solutions require high band-widths for providing feedback for the control of manipulation and yet have been largely unsuccessful. In this study, we have explored a strategy that relies on temporally discrete sensory feedback that is technically simple to provide. According to the Discrete Event-driven Sensory feedback Control (DESC) policy, motor tasks in humans are organized in phases delimited by means of sensory encoded discrete mechanical events. To explore the applicability of DESC for control, we designed a paradigm in which healthy humans operated an artificial robot hand to lift and replace an instrumented object, a task that can readily be learned and mastered under visual control. Assuming that the central nervous system of humans naturally organizes motor tasks based on a strategy akin to DESC, we delivered short-lasting vibrotactile feedback related to events that are known to forcefully affect progression of the grasp-lift-and-hold task. After training, we determined whether the artificial feedback had been integrated with the sensorimotor control by introducing short delays and we indeed observed that the participants significantly delayed subsequent phases of the task. This study thus gives support to the DESC policy hypothesis. Moreover, it demonstrates that humans can integrate temporally discrete sensory feedback while controlling an artificial hand and invites further studies in which inexpensive, noninvasive technology could be used in clever ways to provide physiologically appropriate sensory feedback in upper limb prosthetics with much lower band-width requirements than with traditional solutions."

    "abstract": "Efficacious stroke rehabilitation depends not only on patients' medical treatment but also on their motivation and engagement during rehabilitation exercises. Although traditional rehabilitation exercises are often mundane, technology-assisted upper-limb robotic training can provide engaging and task-oriented training in a natural environment. The factors that influence engagement, however, are not fully understood. This paper therefore studies the relationship between engagement and muscle activities as well as the influencing factors of engagement. To this end, an experiment was conducted using a robotic upper limb rehabilitation system with healthy individuals in three training exercises: (a) a traditional exercise, which is typically used for training the grasping function, (b) a tracking exercise, currently used in robot-assisted stroke patient rehabilitation for fine motor movement, and (c) a video game exercise, which is a proliferating approach of robot-assisted rehabilitation enabling high-level active engagement of stroke patients. These exercises differ not only in the characteristics of the motion that they use but also in their method of triggering engagement. To measure the level of engagement, we used facial expressions, motion analysis of the arm movements, and electromyography. The results show that (a) the video game exercise could engage the participants for a longer period than the other two exercises, (b) the engagement level decreased when the participants became too familiar with the exercises, and (c) analysis of normalized root mean square in electromyographic data indicated that muscle activities were more intense when the participants are engaged. This study shows that several sub-factors on engagement, such as versatility of feedback, cognitive tasks, and competitiveness, may influence engagement more than the others. To maintain a high level of engagement, the rehabilitation system needs to be adaptive, providing different exercises to engage the participants."

    "abstract": "This document provides a review of the techniques and therapies used in gait rehabilitation after stroke. It also examines the possible benefits of including assistive robotic devices and brain-computer interfaces in this field, according to a top-down approach, in which rehabilitation is driven by neural plasticity.The methods reviewed comprise classical gait rehabilitation techniques (neurophysiological and motor learning approaches), functional electrical stimulation (FES), robotic devices, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI).From the analysis of these approaches, we can draw the following conclusions. Regarding classical rehabilitation techniques, there is insufficient evidence to state that a particular approach is more effective in promoting gait recovery than other. Combination of different rehabilitation strategies seems to be more effective than over-ground gait training alone. Robotic devices need further research to show their suitability for walking training and their effects on over-ground gait. The use of FES combined with different walking retraining strategies has shown to result in improvements in hemiplegic gait. Reports on non-invasive BCIs for stroke recovery are limited to the rehabilitation of upper limbs; however, some works suggest that there might be a common mechanism which influences upper and lower limb recovery simultaneously, independently of the limb chosen for the rehabilitation therapy. Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) enables researchers to detect signals from specific regions of the cortex during performance of motor activities for the development of future BCIs. Future research would make possible to analyze the impact of rehabilitation on brain plasticity, in order to adapt treatment resources to meet the needs of each patient and to optimize the recovery process."

    "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate the effect of interventions that promote upper limb (UL) recovery in stroke survivors with severe paresis.\nMethods: A systematic search of the scientific literature from January 1970 to March 2009 was conducted using CINAHL, Cochrane, PEDro, Pubmed and Web of Science. keywords used included stroke, severe, hemiplegia, UL, task-oriented, robot, non-robot and electrical stimulation. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the PEDro rating scale. Studies were grouped into one of three intervention categories: robotic therapy, electrical stimulation or 'other' therapy.\nResults: Seventeen randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. A 'best evidence synthesis' indicated strong evidence that robotic therapy provides a large beneficial effect and limited evidence that electrical stimulation and 'other' interventions provide a large beneficial effect on function. There is no evidence that these interventions influence use of the arm in everyday tasks.\nConclusion: There are a number of newly developed interventions that enable stroke survivors with severe paresis to actively participate in task-oriented practice to promote UL recovery. While these interventions offer some promise for stroke survivors with severe paresis, ultimately, the effectiveness of these interventions will be dependent on whether they lead to restoration of function to the point at which the stroke survivor can practice everyday tasks."

    "abstract": "Patients with issues such as cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis have difficulties with activities of daily living (ADL). Their abilities to perform tasks can be improved through vigorous physical therapy. When that therapy is either not effective or lacking in its progression an assistive robotic device can be used to improve patients' quality of life and help them in accomplishing ADL's. This study presents implementation of an EMG controlled assistive robotic arm to aid patients with upper limb mobility limitations. Using the MYO armband, EMG signals were obtained from three healthy human test subjects and were analyzed in MATLAB® Simulink®. Post signal acquisition, signals were classified to be used as inputs for a Kinova MICO 6 DOF manipulator. Trajectories are planned based on the user EMG signals and robot position data obtained from the Polhemus 6D motion tracker, an IMU-type sensor, which automatically provide position and orientation data. An inverse dynamics controller is developed to drive the robot joints accordingly. Results have shown that the classification accuracy of the EMG signals to control commands for the robot was greater than 90%. The classification accuracy was achieved through the use of a pattern recognition neural network. This preliminary investigation demonstrates the possible future implementation of the system for its intended application."

However, the current myoelectric controller has very limited capability for fine control of grasp forces. We addressed this challenge by designing a hybrid-gain myoelectric controller that switches control gains based on the sensorimotor state of the SHP. This controller was tested against a conventional single-gain (SG) controller, as well as against native hand in able-bodied subjects. We used the following tasks to evaluate the performance of grasp force control: (1) pick and place objects with different size, weight, and fragility levels using power or precision grasp and (2) squeezing objects with different stiffness. Sensory feedback of the grasp forces was provided to the user through a non-invasive, mechanotactile haptic feedback device mounted on the upper arm. We demonstrated that the novel hybrid controller enabled superior task completion speed and fine force control over SG controller in object pick-and-place tasks. We also found that the performance of the hybrid controller qualitatively agrees with the performance of native human hands."

    "title": "Interventions for improving coordination of reach to grasp following stroke: a systematic review",
    "abstract": "Background: Stroke is associated with disruption to efficient and accurate reach to grasp function. Information about treatments for upper limb coordination deficits and their effectiveness may contribute to improved recovery of upper limb function after stroke.\nAims: To identify all existing interventions targeted at coordination of arm and hand segments for reach to grasp following stroke. To determine the effectiveness of current treatments for improving coordination of reach to grasp after stroke.\nSearch strategy: The search included The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; AMED; ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (International) and ISI Proceedings (Conference) databases. A grey literature search included Mednar, Dissertation International, Conference Proceedings, National Institute of Health Clinical Trials and the National Institute of Clinical Studies. We also explored Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Chartered Society of Physiotherapy Research and REHABDATA therapy databases. Finally, the reference lists of identified articles were examined for additional studies. The search spanned from 1950 to April 2010 and was limited to English language papers only.\nMethods of the review: Studies were included with a specific design objective related to coordination of the hand and arm during reach to grasp and involving participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. The review was inclusive with regard to study design. To determine effectiveness of interventions we analysed studies with coordination measures that exist within impairment measurement scales or specific kinematic measures of coordination. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by two independent authors using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Comparable Cohort/Case Control and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Experimental Studies together with additional questions from Downs and Black. Two review authors independently extracted data from the studies using standardised JBI-MAStARI data extraction forms. Pooling of results was not appropriate so the findings were summarised in tables and in narrative form.\nResults: One randomised controlled trial, two case-control studies and four experimental studies without controls were included in this review. The review has identified three categories of potential intervention for improving hand and arm coordination after stroke; functional therapy, biofeedback or electrical stimulation and robot or computerised training. In view of the limited availability of good quality evidence and lack of empirical data, this review does not draw a definitive conclusion for the second question regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving hand and arm coordination after stroke. Improvements in hand and arm coordination during reach to grasp were reported in four studies, whereas one study found no benefit. Two studies did not report specific effects of interventions for hand and arm coordination after stroke.\nImplications for practice: There is currently insufficient evidence to provide strong recommendations about the effect of interventions for improving hand and arm coordination during reach to grasp after stroke.\nImplications for research: Randomised controlled trials of sufficient power with standardised outcome measures are needed to enable meta-analysis comparison in the future. Such studies should include both functional performance and detailed kinematic measures of hand and arm coordination."

    "title": "Cortical Decoding of Individual Finger Group Motions Using ReFIT Kalman Filter",
    "abstract": "Objective: To date, many brain-machine interface (BMI) studies have developed decoding algorithms for neuroprostheses that provide users with precise control of upper arm reaches with some limited grasping capabilities. However, comparatively few have focused on quantifying the performance of precise finger control. Here we expand upon this work by investigating online control of individual finger groups. Approach: We have developed a novel training manipulandum for non-human primate (NHP) studies to isolate the movements of two specific finger groups: index and middle-ring-pinkie (MRP) fingers. We use this device in combination with the ReFIT (Recalibrated Feedback Intention-Trained) Kalman filter to decode the position of each finger group during a single degree of freedom task in two rhesus macaques with Utah arrays in motor cortex. The ReFIT Kalman filter uses a two-stage training approach that improves online control of upper arm tasks with substantial reductions in orbiting time, thus making it a logical first choice for precise finger control. Results: Both animals were able to reliably acquire fingertip targets with both index and MRP fingers, which they did in blocks of finger group specific trials. Decoding from motor signals online, the ReFIT Kalman filter reliably outperformed the standard Kalman filter, measured by bit rate, across all tested finger groups and movements by 31.0 and 35.2%. These decoders were robust when the manipulandum was removed during online control. While index finger movements and middle-ring-pinkie finger movements could be differentiated from each other with 81.7% accuracy across both subjects, the linear Kalman filter was not sufficient for decoding both finger groups together due to significant unwanted movement in the stationary finger, potentially due to co-contraction. Significance: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic and biomimetic separation of digits for continuous online decoding in a NHP as well as the first demonstration of the ReFIT Kalman filter improving the performance of precise finger decoding. These results suggest that novel nonlinear approaches, apparently not necessary for center out reaches or gross hand motions, may be necessary to achieve independent and precise control of individual fingers."

    "title": "Advantages of externally powered prosthesis with feedback system using pseudo-cineplasty",
    "abstract": "Externally powered upper-limb prostheses are difficult to use because of the lack of sensory feedback. Neuroprostheses have recently been developed for people with upper-limb amputation but are complicated, expensive, and still developing. We therefore designed a simple system by combining pseudo-cineplasty with extended physiological proprioception to provide sensory feedback to the body. We penetrated the palmaris longus tendon percutaneously with a metal ring, similar to that used in body piercing, in a nondisabled subject as a pseudo-cineplasty. The tendon and ring were connected to the system, and a sensory feedback experiment was performed. We investigated the ability of the user to determine the size of an object grasped by the prosthetic hand without visual information. The subject could distinguish between large and small objects with 100% accuracy and between small, medium, and large objects with 80% accuracy. In pseudo-cineplasty, control and sensory feedback are natural because the prosthetic hand is controlled by muscle contraction. Tension transmitted from the prosthetic hand is sensed via muscle spindles and skin sensors. This technique allows only partial sensory feedback but appears to offer several advantages over other human-machine interfaces."

    "abstract": "Peripheral intraneural stimulation can provide tactile information to amputees. However, efforts are still necessary to identify encoding strategy eliciting percepts that are felt as both natural and effective for prosthesis control. Here we compared the naturalness and efficacy of different encoding strategies to deliver neural stimulation to trans-radial amputees implanted with intraneural electrodes. Biomimetic frequency modulation was perceived as more natural, while amplitude modulation enabled better performance in tasks requiring fine identification of the applied force. Notably, the optimal combination of naturalness and sensitivity of the tactile feedback can be achieved with \"hybrid\" encoding strategies based on simultaneous biomimetic frequency and amplitude neuromodulation. These strategies improved the gross manual dexterity of the subjects during functional task while maintaining high levels of manual accuracy. They also improved prosthesis embodiment, reducing abnormal phantom limb perceptions (\"telescoping effect\"). Hybrid strategies are able to provide highly sensitive and natural percepts and should be preferred. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

The introduction of a sensory feedback can help the subject to perform the rehabilitation task with an ergonomic posture. In this work, the introduction of visual and vibrotactile feedback in a robotic platform for upper limb rehabilitation has been proposed to ensure ergonomic posture during rehabilitation. The two feedback modalities have been used to provide information about incorrect neck and trunk posture. Ten healthy subjects have been involved in this study. Each of them performed 3D reaching movements with the aid of the robotic platform in three different conditions, i.e. without feedback, with visual feedback and with vibrotactile feedback, and a comparative analysis has been carried out to evaluate feedback effectiveness, acceptance and performance. Experimental results show that in case of no feedback the subjects reach and maintain configurations that can lead to incorrect neck and trunk configurations and therefore, if repeated, to musculoskeletal disorders. Conversely, with visual or vibrotactile feedback, the subjects tend to correct inappropriate posture with both trunk and head during task performing."

    "title": "Visuotactile synchrony of stimulation-induced sensation and natural somatosensation",
    "abstract": "Objective: Previous studies suggest that somatosensory feedback has the potential to improve the functional performance of prostheses, reduce phantom pain, and enhance embodiment of sensory-enabled prosthetic devices. To maximize such benefits for amputees, the temporal properties of the sensory feedback must resemble those of natural somatosensation in an intact limb.\nApproach: To better understand temporal perception of artificial sensation, we characterized the perception of visuotactile synchrony for tactile perception restored via peripheral nerve stimulation. We electrically activated nerves in the residual limbs of two trans-tibial amputees and two trans-radial amputees via non-penetrating nerve cuff electrodes, which elicited sensations referred to the missing limbs.\nMain results: Our findings suggest that with respect to vision, stimulation-induced sensation has a point of subjective simultaneity (PSS; processing time) and just noticeable difference (JND; temporal sensitivity) that are similar to natural touch. The JND was not significantly different between the participants with upper- and lower-limb amputations. However, the PSS indicated that sensations evoked in the missing leg must occur significantly earlier than those in the hand to be perceived as maximally synchronous with vision. Furthermore, we examined visuotactile synchrony in the context of a functional task during which stimulation was triggered by pressure applied to the prosthesis. Stimulation-induced sensation could be delayed up to 111 ± 62 ms without the delay being reliably detected.\nSignificance: The quantitative temporal properties of stimulation-induced perception were previously unknown and will contribute to design specifications for future sensory neuroprostheses."

    "abstract": "The development of an innovative functional assessment procedure based on the combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and robot-assisted upper limb devices may provide new insights into the dynamics of cortical reorganization promoted by rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) in alpha and beta bands in a patient with pure sensory stroke who underwent a specific rehabilitation program for somatic sensation recovery. A 49-year-old, right-handed woman (time since stroke, 12 months) with severe upper limb somatic sensation deficits was tested using validated clinical scales and a standardized video-EEG system combined with the Bi-Manu-Track robot-assisted arm trainer protocol. The patient underwent a 3-month home-based rehabilitation program for promoting upper limb recovery (1 hour a day for 5 days a week). She was tested before treatment, at 1-month, and at 3-month during treatment. Results showed progressive recovery of upper limb function over time. These effects were associated with specific changes in the modulation of alpha and beta event-related synchronization/desynchronization. This unique study provides new perspectives for the assessment of functional deficits and changes in cortical activity promoted by rehabilitation in poststroke patients."

    "abstract": "Dexterous hand movement is possible due to closed loop control dependent on efferent motor output and afferent sensory feedback. This control strategy is significantly altered in those with upper limb amputation as sensations of touch and movement are inherently lost. For upper limb prosthetic users, the absence of sensory feedback impedes efficient use of the prosthesis and is highlighted as a major factor contributing to user rejection of myoelectric prostheses. Numerous sensory feedback systems have been proposed in literature to address this gap in prosthetic control; however, these systems have yet to be implemented for long term use. Methodologies for communicating prosthetic grasp and touch information are reviewed, including discussion of selected designs and test results. With a focus on clinical and translational challenges, this review highlights and compares techniques employed to provide amputees with sensory feedback. Additionally, promising future directions are discussed and highlighted."

    "title": "Selectivity and Longevity of Peripheral-Nerve and Machine Interfaces: A Review",
    "abstract": "For those individuals with upper-extremity amputation, a daily normal living activity is no longer possible or it requires additional effort and time. With the aim of restoring their sensory and motor functions, theoretical and technological investigations have been carried out in the field of neuroprosthetic systems. For transmission of sensory feedback, several interfacing modalities including indirect (non-invasive), direct-to-peripheral-nerve (invasive), and cortical stimulation have been applied. Peripheral nerve interfaces demonstrate an edge over the cortical interfaces due to the sensitivity in attaining cortical brain signals. The peripheral nerve interfaces are highly dependent on interface designs and are required to be biocompatible with the nerves to achieve prolonged stability and longevity. Another criterion is the selection of nerves that allows minimal invasiveness and damages as well as high selectivity for a large number of nerve fascicles. In this paper, we review the nerve-machine interface modalities noted above with more focus on peripheral nerve interfaces, which are responsible for provision of sensory feedback. The invasive interfaces for recording and stimulation of electro-neurographic signals include intra-fascicular, regenerative-type interfaces that provide multiple contact channels to a group of axons inside the nerve and the extra-neural-cuff-type interfaces that enable interaction with many axons around the periphery of the nerve. Section Current Prosthetic Technology summarizes the advancements made to date in the field of neuroprosthetics toward the achievement of a bidirectional nerve-machine interface with more focus on sensory feedback. In the Discussion section, the authors propose a hybrid interface technique for achieving better selectivity and long-term stability using the available nerve interfacing techniques."

    "title": "Differential Activation of Biceps Brachii Muscle Compartments for Human-Machine Interfacing",
    "abstract": "A central challenge for myoelectric limb prostheses resides in the fact that, as the level of amputation becomes more proximal, the number of functions to be replaced increases, while the number of muscles available to collect input signals for control decreases. Differential activation of compartments from a single muscle could provide additional control sites. However, such feat is not naturally under voluntary control. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of learning to differentially activate the two heads of the bicep brachii muscle (BBM), by using biofeedback via high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG). Using a one degree of freedom Fitts' law test, we observed that eight subjects could learn to control the center of gravity of BBM's myoelectric activity. In addition, we examined the activations patterns of BBM that allow for the decoding of distal hand movements. These patterns were found highly individual, but different enough to allow for decoding of motor volition of distal joints. These findings represent promising venues to increase the functionality of myoelectrically controlled upper limb prostheses."

However, prevalent methods intended for such decoding of movement intent from the surface electromyogram (sEMG) based on pattern recognition typically do not capitalize on the inherently time series-like nature of the acquired signals. In this paper, we present the results from a comparative study in which the performances of traditional cross-sectional pattern recognition methods were compared with that of a classifier built on the natural assumption of temporal ordering by utilizing a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The resulting evaluation indicate that the LSTM approach outperforms traditional gesture recognition techniques which are based on cross-sectional inference. These findings held both when the LSTM classifier operated on conventional features and on raw sEMG and for both healthy subjects and transradial amputees."

    "title": "Systematic changes in position sense accompany normal aging across adulthood",
    "abstract": "Background: Development of clinical neurological assessments aimed at separating normal from abnormal capabilities requires a comprehensive understanding of how basic neurological functions change (or do not change) with increasing age across adulthood. In the case of proprioception, the research literature has failed to conclusively determine whether or not position sense in the upper limb deteriorates in elderly individuals. The present study was conducted a) to quantify whether upper limb position sense deteriorates with increasing age, and b) to generate a set of normative data that can be used for future comparisons with clinical populations.\nMethods: We examined position sense in 209 healthy males and females between the ages of 18 and 90 using a robotic arm position-matching task that is both objective and reliable. In this task, the robot moved an arm to one of nine positions and subjects attempted to mirror-match that position with the opposite limb. Measures of position sense were recorded by the robotic apparatus in hand-and joint-based coordinates, and linear regressions were used to quantify age-related changes and percentile boundaries of normal behaviour. For clinical comparisons, we also examined influences of sex (male versus female) and test-hand (dominant versus non-dominant) on all measures of position sense.\nResults: Analyses of hand-based parameters identified several measures of position sense (Variability, Shift, Spatial Contraction, Absolute Error) with significant effects of age, sex, and test-hand. Joint-based parameters at the shoulder (Absolute Error) and elbow (Variability, Shift, Absolute Error) also exhibited significant effects of age and test-hand.\nConclusions: The present study provides strong evidence that several measures of upper extremity position sense exhibit declines with age. Furthermore, this data provides a basis for quantifying when changes in position sense are related to normal aging or alternatively, pathology."

    "abstract": "A current challenge with human-machine cooperation systems is to estimate human motions to facilitate natural cooperation and safety of the human. It is a logical approach to estimate the motions from their sources (skeletal muscles); thus, we employed surface electromyography (SEMG) to estimate body motions. In this paper, we investigated a cooperative manipulation control by an upper limb motion estimation method using SEMG and joint angular velocities. The SEMG signals from five upper limb muscles and angular velocities of the limb joints were used to approximate the flexion-extension of the limb in the 2-D sagittal plane. The experimental results showed that the proposed estimation method provides acceptable performance of the motion estimation [normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) <0.15, correlation coefficient (CC) >0.9] under the noncontact condition. From the analysis of the results, we found the necessity of the angular velocity input and estimation error feedback due to physical contact. Our results suggest that the estimation method can be useful for a natural human-machine cooperation control."

    "title": "The impact of the stimulation frequency on closed-loop control with electrotactile feedback",
    "abstract": "Background: Electrocutaneous stimulation can restore the missing sensory information to prosthetic users. In electrotactile feedback, the information about the prosthesis state is transmitted in the form of pulse trains. The stimulation frequency is an important parameter since it influences the data transmission rate over the feedback channel as well as the form of the elicited tactile sensations.\nMethods: We evaluated the influence of the stimulation frequency on the subject's ability to utilize the feedback information during electrotactile closed-loop control. Ten healthy subjects performed a real-time compensatory tracking (standard test bench) of sinusoids and pseudorandom signals using either visual feedback (benchmark) or electrocutaneous feedback in seven conditions characterized by different combinations of the stimulation frequency (FSTIM) and tracking error sampling rate (FTE). The tracking error was transmitted using two concentric electrodes placed on the forearm. The quality of tracking was assessed using the Squared Pearson Correlation Coefficient (SPCC), the Normalized Root Mean Square Tracking Error (NRMSTE) and the time delay between the reference and generated trajectories (TDIO).\nResults: The results demonstrated that FSTIM was more important for the control performance than FTE. The quality of tracking deteriorated with a decrease in the stimulation frequency, SPCC and NRMSTE (mean) were 87.5% and 9.4% in the condition 100/100 (FTE/FSTIM), respectively, and deteriorated to 61.1% and 15.3% in 5/5, respectively, while the TDIO increased from 359.8 ms in 100/100 to 1009 ms in 5/5. However, the performance recovered when the tracking error sampled at a low rate was delivered using a high stimulation frequency (SPCC = 83.6%, NRMSTE = 10.3%, TDIO = 415.6 ms, in 5/100).\nConclusions: The likely reason for the performance decrease and recovery was that the stimulation frequency critically influenced the tactile perception quality and thereby the effective rate of information transfer through the feedback channel. The outcome of this study can facilitate the selection of optimal system parameters for somatosensory feedback in upper limb prostheses. The results imply that the feedback variables (e.g., grasping force) should be transmitted at relatively high frequencies of stimulation (>25 Hz), but that they can be sampled at much lower rates (e.g., 5 Hz)."

    "title": "Strategies for providing upper extremity amputees with tactile and hand position feedback--moving closer to the bionic arm",
    "abstract": "A continuing challenge for prostheses developers is to replace the sensory function of the hand. This includes tactile sensitivity such as finger contact, grip force, object slippage, surface texture and temperature, as well as proprioceptive sense. One approach is sensory substitution whereby an intact sensory system such as vision, hearing or cutaneous sensation elsewhere on the body is used as an input channel for information related to the prosthesis. A second technique involves using electrical stimulation to deliver sensor derived information directly to the peripheral afferent nerves within the residual limb. Stimulation of the relevant afferent nerves can ultimately come closest to restoring the original sensory perceptions of the hand, and to this end, researchers have already demonstrated some degree of functionality of the transected sensory nerves in studies with amputee subjects. This paper provides an overview of different types of nerve interface components and the advantages and disadvantages of employing each of them in sensory feedback systems. Issues of sensory perception, neurophysiology and anatomy relevant to hand sensation and function are discussed with respect to the selection of the different types of nerve interfaces. The goal of this paper is to outline what can be accomplished for implementing sensation into artificial arms in the near term by applying what is present or presently attainable technology."

    "title": "Descending corticospinal control of intersegmental dynamics",
    "abstract": "To make an accurate movement, the CNS has to overcome the inherent complexities of the multijoint limb. For example, interaction torques arise when motion of individual arm segments propagates to adjacent segments causing their movement without any muscle contractions. Since these passive joint torques significantly add to the overall torques generated by active muscular contractions, they must be taken into account during planning or execution of goal-directed movements. We investigated the role of the corticospinal tract in compensating for the interaction torques during arm movements in humans. Twelve subjects reached to visual targets with their arm supported by a robotic exoskeleton. Reaching to one target was accompanied by interaction torques that assisted the movement, while reaching to the other target was accompanied by interaction torques that resisted the movement. Corticospinal excitability was assessed at different times during movement using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the upper-arm region of M1 (primary motor cortex). We found that TMS responses in shoulder monoarticular and elbow-shoulder biarticular muscles changed together with the interaction torques during movements in which the interaction torques were resistive. In contrast, TMS responses did not correlate with assistive interaction torques or with co-contraction. This suggests that the descending motor command includes compensation for passive limb dynamics. Furthermore, our results suggest that compensation for interaction torques involves the biarticular muscles, which span both shoulder and elbow joints and are in a biomechanically advantageous position to provide such compensation."

Thematic analysis was conducted using an inductive approach.\nResults: Participants reported positive experiences with the robotic stroke therapy delivery and monitoring system. Benefits included convenience, self-reported increased mobility, improved mood and an outlet for physical and mental tension and anxiety. Barriers to use were few and included difficulties with placing the device on the body, bulkiness of the monitor and modem connection problems.\nConclusions: Telerehabilitation robotic devices can be used as a tool to extend effective, evidence-based and specialized rehabilitation services for upper and lower limb rehabilitation to rural Veterans with poor access to care. Implications for Rehabilitation Participants whose formal therapy services had ended either because they had exhausted their benefits or because traveling to outpatient therapy was too cumbersome due to distance were able to perform therapeutic activities in the home daily (or at least multiple times per week). Participants who were still receiving formal therapy services either in-home or in the clinic were able to perform therapeutic activities in the home on the days they were not attending/receiving formal therapy. Based on the feedback from these veterans and their caregivers, the manufacturing company is working on modifying the devices to be less cumbersome and more user-friendly (lighter-weight, more mobile, changing software, etc.), as well as more adaptable to participants' homes. Removing these specific barriers will potentially allow participants to utilize the device more easily and more frequently. Since participants expressed that they wished they could have the device in their homes longer than the 3-month usage period required for this pilot project, the project team is working on a proposal to extend this project to a wider area and the new paradigm would extend the usage period until the patient reaches a plateau in progress or no longer wants to use the device."

    "abstract": "Objective: The ease of use and number of degrees of freedom of current myoelectric hand prostheses is limited by the information content and reliability of the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals used to control them. For example, cross-talk limits the capacity to pick up signals from small or deep muscles, such as the forearm muscles for distal arm amputations, or sites of targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) for proximal amputations. Here we test if signals recorded from the fully implanted, induction-powered wireless Myoplant system allow long-term decoding of continuous as well as discrete movement parameters with better reliability than equivalent sEMG recordings. The Myoplant system uses a centralized implant to transmit broadband EMG activity from four distributed bipolar epimysial electrodes.\nApproach: Two Rhesus macaques received implants in their backs, while electrodes were placed in their upper arm. One of the monkeys was trained to do a cursor task via a haptic robot, allowing us to control the forces exerted by the animal during arm movements. The second animal was trained to perform a center-out reaching task on a touchscreen. We compared the implanted system with concurrent sEMG recordings by evaluating our ability to decode time-varying force in one animal and discrete reach directions in the other from multiple features extracted from the raw EMG signals.\nMain results: In both cases, data from the implant allowed a decoder trained with data from a single day to maintain an accurate decoding performance during the following months, which was not the case for concurrent surface EMG recordings conducted simultaneously over the same muscles.\nSignificance: These results show that a fully implantable, centralized wireless EMG system is particularly suited for long-term stable decoding of dynamic movements in demanding applications such as advanced forelimb prosthetics in a wide range of configurations (distal amputations, TMR)."

    "title": "Design of continuous EMG classification approaches towards the control of a robotic exoskeleton in reaching movements",
    "abstract": "Myoelectric control of rehabilitation devices engages active recruitment of muscles for motor task accomplishment, which has been proven to be essential in motor rehabilitation. Unfortunately, most electromyographic (EMG) activity-based controls are limited to one single degree-of-freedom (DoF), not permitting multi-joint functional tasks. On the other hand, discrete EMG-triggered approaches fail to provide continuous feedback about muscle recruitment during movement. For such purposes, myoelectric interfaces for continuous recognition of functional movements are necessary. Here we recorded EMG activity using 5 bipolar electrodes placed on the upper-arm in 8 healthy participants while they performed reaching movements in 8 different directions. A pseudo on-line system was developed to continuously predict movement intention and attempted arm direction. We evaluated two hierarchical classification approaches. Movement intention detection triggered different movement direction classifiers (4 or 8 classes) that were trained and tested over a 5-fold cross validation. We also investigated the effect of 3 different window lengths to extract EMG features on classification. We obtained classification accuracies above 70% for both hierarchical approaches. These results highlight the viability of classifying online 8 upper-arm different directions using surface EMG activity of 5 muscles and represent a first step towards an online EMG-based control for rehabilitation devices."

Therapist criteria for upper limb rehabilitation technology are suggested which are used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a number of current technological systems.\nConclusion: This review shows that technology for supporting upper limb training after stroke needs to align with the evolution in rehabilitation training approaches of the last decade.

The degree of disability of these individuals could potentially be reduced by using robotic devices that assist their movements in activities of daily living. One approach to control such robotic systems is the use of a brain-computer interface, which detects the user's intention. This study proposes a method for estimating the user's intention using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The proposed method is capable of discriminating rest from various imagined arm movements, including grasping and elbow flexion. The features extracted from EEG signals are autoregressive model coefficients, root-mean-square amplitude, and waveform length. Support vector machine was used as a classifier, distinguishing class labels corresponding to rest and imagined arm movements. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using cross-validation. Average accuracies of 91.8 ± 5.8 and 90 ± 4.1 % were obtained for distinguishing rest versus grasping and rest versus elbow flexion. The results show that the proposed scheme provides 18.9, 17.1, and 16.5 % higher classification accuracies for distinguishing rest versus grasping and 21.9, 17.6, and 18.1 % higher classification accuracies for distinguishing rest versus elbow flexion compared with those obtained using filter bank common spatial pattern, band power, and common spatial pattern methods, respectively, which are widely used in the literature."

The goal of these surveys was to elicit requirements health care professionals pose on rehabilitation devices for upper limb training to enable an effective, efficient and satisfying use in a rehabilitation environment. In a two-step process, two different methods - semi-structured interviews and online questionnaire - were combined to collect data from two independent populations. The analysis of the survey showed that the use of a rehabilitation device should be time-effective and bring joy and that the device should be customizable and provide feedback."

    "title": "Decoding Lower Limb Muscle Activity and Kinematics from Cortical Neural Spike Trains during Monkey Performing Stand and Squat Movements",
    "abstract": "Extensive literatures have shown approaches for decoding upper limb kinematics or muscle activity using multichannel cortical spike recordings toward brain machine interface (BMI) applications. However, similar topics regarding lower limb remain relatively scarce. We previously reported a system for training monkeys to perform visually guided stand and squat tasks. The current study, as a follow-up extension, investigates whether lower limb kinematics and muscle activity characterized by electromyography (EMG) signals during monkey performing stand/squat movements can be accurately decoded from neural spike trains in primary motor cortex (M1). Two monkeys were used in this study. Subdermal intramuscular EMG electrodes were implanted to 8 right leg/thigh muscles. With ample data collected from neurons from a large brain area, we performed a spike triggered average (SpTA) analysis and got a series of density contours which revealed the spatial distributions of different muscle-innervating neurons corresponding to each given muscle. Based on the guidance of these results, we identified the locations optimal for chronic electrode implantation and subsequently carried on chronic neural data recordings. A recursive Bayesian estimation framework was proposed for decoding EMG signals together with kinematics from M1 spike trains. Two specific algorithms were implemented: a standard Kalman filter and an unscented Kalman filter. For the latter one, an artificial neural network was incorporated to deal with the nonlinearity in neural tuning. High correlation coefficient and signal to noise ratio between the predicted and the actual data were achieved for both EMG signals and kinematics on both monkeys. Higher decoding accuracy and faster convergence rate could be achieved with the unscented Kalman filter. These results demonstrate that lower limb EMG signals and kinematics during monkey stand/squat can be accurately decoded from a group of M1 neurons with the proposed algorithms. Our findings provide new insights for extending current BMI design concepts and techniques on upper limbs to lower limb circumstances. Brain controlled exoskeleton, prostheses or neuromuscular electrical stimulators for lower limbs are expected to be developed, which enables the subject to manipulate complex biomechatronic devices with mind in more harmonized manner."

    "title": "Myoelectrically controlled wrist robot for stroke rehabilitation",
    "abstract": "Background: Robot-assisted rehabilitation is an advanced new technology in stroke rehabilitation to provide intensive training. Post-stroke motor recovery depends on active rehabilitation by voluntary participation of patient's paretic motor system as early as possible in order to promote reorganization of brain. However, voluntary residual motor efforts to the affected limb have not been involved enough in most robot-assisted rehabilitation for patients after stroke. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of robot-assisted rehabilitation using myoelectric control on upper limb motor recovery.\nMethods: In the present study, an exoskeleton-type rehabilitation robotic system was designed to provide voluntarily controlled assisted torque to the affected wrist. Voluntary intention was involved by using the residual surface electromyography (EMG) from flexor carpi radialis(FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR)on the affected limb to control the mechanical assistance provided by the robotic system during wrist flexion and extension in a 20-session training. The system also applied constant resistant torque to the affected wrist during the training. Sixteen subjects after stroke had been recruited for evaluating the tracking performance and therapeutical effects of myoelectrically controlled robotic system.\nResults: With the myoelectrically-controlled assistive torque, stroke survivors could reach a larger range of motion with a significant decrease in the EMG signal from the agonist muscles. The stroke survivors could be trained in the unreached range with their voluntary residual EMG on the paretic side. After 20-session rehabilitation training, there was a non-significant increase in the range of motion and a significant decrease in the root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual wrist angle and target angle. Significant improvements also could be found in muscle strength and clinical scales.\nConclusions: These results indicate that robot-aided therapy with voluntary participation of patient's paretic motor system using myoelectric control might have positive effect on upper limb motor recovery."

    "title": "On the effect of muscular cocontraction on the 3-D human arm impedance",
    "abstract": "Humans have the inherent ability to perform highly dexterous tasks with their arms, involving maintenance of posture, movement, and interaction with the environment. The latter requires the human to control the dynamic characteristics of the upper limb musculoskeletal system. These characteristics are quantitatively represented by inertia, damping, and stiffness, which are measures of mechanical impedance. Many previous studies have shown that arm posture is a dominant factor in determining the end point impedance on a horizontal plane. This paper presents the characterization of the end point impedance of the human arm in 3-D space. Moreover, it models the regulation of the arm impedance with muscle cocontraction. The characterization is made by route of experimental trials where human subjects maintained arm posture while their arms were perturbed by a robot arm. Furthermore, the subjects were asked to control the level of their arm muscles' cocontraction, using visual feedback, in order to investigate the effect of muscle cocontraction on the arm impedance. The results of this study show an anisotropic increase of arm stiffness due to muscle cocontraction. These results could improve our understanding of the human arm biomechanics, as well as provide implications for human motor control-specifically the control of arm impedance through muscle cocontraction."

    "title": "Differentiated Effects of Robot Hand Training With and Without Neural Guidance on Neuroplasticity Patterns in Chronic Stroke",
    "abstract": "Robot-assisted training combined with neural guided strategy has been increasingly applied to stroke rehabilitation. However, the induced neuroplasticity is seldom characterized. It is still uncertain whether this kind of guidance could enhance the long-term training effect for stroke motor recovery. This study was conducted to explore the clinical improvement and the neurological changes after 20-session guided or non-guided robot hand training using two measures: changes in brain discriminant ability between motor-imagery and resting states revealed from electroencephalography (EEG) signals and changes in brain network variability revealed from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in 24 chronic stroke subjects. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive either combined action observation (AO) with EEG-guided robot-hand training (RobotEEG_AO, n = 13) or robot-hand training without AO and EEG guidance (Robotnon-EEG_Text, n = 11). The robot hand in RobotEEG_AO group was activated only when significant mu suppression (8-12 Hz) was detected from subjects' EEG signals in ipsilesional hemisphere, while the robot hand in Robotnon-EEG_Text group was randomly activated regardless of their EEG signals. Paretic upper-limb motor functions were evaluated at three time-points: before, immediately after and 6 months after the interventions. Only RobotEEG_AO group showed a long-term significant improvement in their upper-limb motor functions while no significant and long-lasting training effect on the paretic motor functions was shown in Robotnon-EEG_Text group. Significant neuroplasticity changes were only observed in RobotEEG_AO group as well. The brain discriminant ability based on the ipsilesional EEG signals significantly improved after intervention. For brain network variability, the whole brain was first divided into six functional subnetworks, and significant increase in the temporal variability was found in four out of the six subnetworks, including sensory-motor areas, attention network, auditory network, and default mode network after intervention. Our results revealed the differences in the long-term training effect and the neuroplasticity changes following the two interventional strategies: with and without neural guidance. The findings might imply that sustainable motor function improvement could be achieved through proper neural guidance, which might provide insights into strategies for effective stroke rehabilitation. Furthermore, neuroplasticity could be promoted more profoundly by the intervention with proper neurofeedback, and might be shaped in relation to better motor skill acquisition."

    "abstract": "Background: Accurate prediction of electromyographic (EMG) signals associated with a variety of motor behaviors could, in theory, serve as activity templates needed to evoke movements in paralyzed individuals using functional electrical stimulation. Such predictions should encompass complex multi-joint movements and include interactions with objects in the environment.\nMethods: Here we tested the ability of different artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict EMG activities of 12 arm muscles while human subjects made free movements of the arm or grasped and moved objects of different weights and dimensions. Inputs to the trained ANNs included hand position, hand orientation, and thumb grip force.\nResults: The ability of ANNs to predict EMG was equally as good for tasks involving interactions with external loads as for unloaded movements. The ANN that yielded the best predictions was a feed-forward network consisting of a single hidden layer of 30 neural elements. For this network, the average coefficient of determination (R2 value) between predicted and actual EMG signals across all nine subjects and 12 muscles during movements that involved episodes of moving objects was 0.43.\nConclusion: This reasonable accuracy suggests that ANNs could be used to provide an initial estimate of the complex patterns of muscle stimulation needed to produce a wide array of movements, including those involving object interaction, in paralyzed individuals."

    "abstract": "Osseoperception is the sensation arising from the mechanical stimulation of a bone-anchored prosthesis. Here we show that not only touch, but also hearing is involved in this phenomenon. Using mechanical vibrations ranging from 0.1 to 6 kHz, we performed four psychophysical measures (perception threshold, sensation discrimination, frequency discrimination and reaction time) on 12 upper and lower limb amputees and found that subjects: consistently reported perceiving a sound when the stimulus was delivered at frequencies equal to or above 400 Hz; were able to discriminate frequency differences between stimuli delivered at high stimulation frequencies (~1500 Hz); improved their reaction time for bimodal stimuli (i.e. when both vibration and sound were perceived). Our results demonstrate that osseoperception is a multisensory perception, which can explain the improved environment perception of bone-anchored prosthesis users. This phenomenon might be exploited in novel prosthetic devices to enhance their control, thus ultimately improving the amputees' quality of life."

    "abstract": "Robotic devices for therapy have the potential to enable intensive, fully customized home rehabilitation over extended periods for individuals with stroke and traumatic brain injury, thus empowering them to maximize their functional recovery. For robotic rehabilitation to be most effective, systems must have the capacity to assign performance goals to the user and to increment those goals to encourage performance improvement. Otherwise, individuals may plateau at an artificially low level of function. Frequent goal change is needed to motivate improvements in performance by individuals with brain injury; but because of entrenched habits, these individuals may avoid striving for goals that they perceive as becoming ever more difficult. For this reason, implicit, undetectable goal change (distortion) may be more effective than explicit goal change at optimizing the motor performance of some individuals with brain injury. This paper reviews a body of work that provides a basis for incorporating implicit goal change into a robotic rehabilitation paradigm. This work was conducted with individuals without disability to provide foundational knowledge for using goal change in a robotic environment. In addition, we compare motor performance with goal change to performance with no goal or with a static goal for individuals without brain injury. Our results show that goal change can improve motor performance when participants attend to visual feedback. Building on these preliminary results can lead to more effective robotic paradigms for the rehabilitation of individuals with brain injury, including individuals with cerebral palsy."

    "abstract": "Background: Abnormal muscle co-activation contributes to impairment after stroke. We developed a myoelectric computer interface (MyoCI) training paradigm to reduce abnormal co-activation. MyoCI provides intuitive feedback about muscle activation patterns, enabling decoupling of these muscles.\nObjective: To investigate tolerability and effects of MyoCI training of 3 muscle pairs on arm motor recovery after stroke, including effects of training dose and isometric versus movement-based training.\nMethods: We randomized chronic stroke survivors with moderate-to-severe arm impairment to 3 groups. Two groups tested different doses of isometric MyoCI (60 vs 90 minutes), and one group tested MyoCI without arm restraint (90 minutes), over 6 weeks. Primary outcome was arm impairment (Fugl-Meyer Assessment). Secondary outcomes included function, spasticity, and elbow range-of-motion at weeks 6 and 10.\nResults: Over all 32 subjects, MyoCI training of 3 muscle pairs significantly reduced impairment (Fugl-Meyer Assessment) by 3.3 ± 0.6 and 3.1 ± 0.7 ( P < 10-4) at weeks 6 and 10, respectively. Each group improved significantly from baseline; no significant differences were seen between groups. Participants' lab-based and home-based function also improved at weeks 6 and 10 ( P ≤ .01). Spasticity also decreased over all subjects, and elbow range-of-motion improved. Both moderately and severely impaired patients showed significant improvement. No participants had training-related adverse events. MyoCI reduced abnormal co-activation, which appeared to transfer to reaching in the movement group.\nConclusions: MyoCI is a well-tolerated, novel rehabilitation tool that enables stroke survivors to reduce abnormal co-activation. It may reduce impairment and spasticity and improve arm function, even in severely impaired patients."

    "title": "The extraction of neural information from the surface EMG for the control of upper-limb prostheses: emerging avenues and challenges",
    "abstract": "Despite not recording directly from neural cells, the surface electromyogram (EMG) signal contains information on the neural drive to muscles, i.e., the spike trains of motor neurons. Using this property, myoelectric control consists of the recording of EMG signals for extracting control signals to command external devices, such as hand prostheses. In commercial control systems, the intensity of muscle activity is extracted from the EMG and used for single degrees of freedom activation (direct control). Over the past 60 years, academic research has progressed to more sophisticated approaches but, surprisingly, none of these academic achievements has been implemented in commercial systems so far. We provide an overview of both commercial and academic myoelectric control systems and we analyze their performance with respect to the characteristics of the ideal myocontroller. Classic and relatively novel academic methods are described, including techniques for simultaneous and proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom and the use of individual motor neuron spike trains for direct control. The conclusion is that the gap between industry and academia is due to the relatively small functional improvement in daily situations that academic systems offer, despite the promising laboratory results, at the expense of a substantial reduction in robustness. None of the systems so far proposed in the literature fulfills all the important criteria needed for widespread acceptance by the patients, i.e. intuitive, closed-loop, adaptive, and robust real-time ( 200 ms delay) control, minimal number of recording electrodes with low sensitivity to repositioning, minimal training, limited complexity and low consumption. Nonetheless, in recent years, important efforts have been invested in matching these criteria, with relevant steps forwards."

    "abstract": "Brain-machine interface (BMI)-driven robot-assisted neurorehabilitation intervention has demonstrated improvement in upper-limb (UL) motor function, specifically, with post-stroke hemiparetic patients. However, neurophysiological patterns related to such interventions are not well understood. This paper examined the longitudinal changes in band-limited resting-state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) networks in association with post-stroke UL functional recovery achieved by a multimodal intervention involving motor attempt (MA)-based BMI and robotic hand-exoskeleton. Four adults were rehabilitated with the intervention for a period lasting up to six weeks. RS magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals, Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and grip strength (GS) measures were recorded at five equispaced sessions over the intervention period. An average post-interventional increase of 100.0% (p=0.00028) and 88.0% was attained for ARAT and GS, respectively. A cluster-based statistical test involving correlation estimates between beta-band (15-26 Hz) RS-MEG FCs and UL functional recovery provided the positively correlated sub-networks in both the contralesional and ipsilesional motor cortices. The frontoparietal FC exhibited hemispheric lateralization wherein the majority of the positively and negatively correlated connections were found in contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres, respectively. Our findings are consistent with the theory of bilateral motor cortical association with UL recovery and predict novel FC patterns that can be important for higher level cognitive functions."

    "abstract": "Proprioception, or sense of position and movement of the body, strongly correlates with motor recovery of the hemiplegic arm. The evaluation of the awareness of the location of joints in space involves measuring the accuracy of joint-angle replication. Robotic devices allow an accurate manipulation of joint movements necessary to assess proprioceptive status. This study evaluated the proprioceptive performance of healthy subjects by mean of the H-Man, a planar robot designed for upper-limb rehabilitation to gather preliminary normative data for neurorehabilitation applications. Twelve participants were equally divided into Aged and Young groups and were asked to indicate when their dominant hand position matched a predefined target in the contralateral, sagittal and ipsilateral direction. Results indicated a better performance for movements towards the contralateral target in terms of both absolute and signed error while there was not a significant effect of age group. Error variability was not affected by the target location and participants' age. The present study established preliminary proprioceptive metrics that could assist in providing information about the normal range of proprioceptive acuity of healthy subjects of different age."

    "abstract": "Background: Robotic arm supports aim at improving the quality of life for adults with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) by augmenting their residual functional abilities. A critical component of robotic arm supports is the control interface, as is it responsible for the human-machine interaction. Our previous studies showed the feasibility of using surface electromyography (sEMG) as a control interface to operate robotic arm supports in adults with DMD (22-24 years-old). However, in the biomedical engineering community there is an often raised skepticism on whether adults with DMD at the last stage of their disease have sEMG signals that can be measured and used for control.\nFindings: In this study sEMG signals from Biceps and Triceps Brachii muscles were measured for the first time in a 37 year-old man with DMD (Brooke 6) that lost his arm function 15 years ago. The sEMG signals were measured during maximal and sub-maximal voluntary isometric contractions and evaluated in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and co-activation ratio. Beyond the profound deterioration of the muscles, we found that sEMG signals from both Biceps and Triceps muscles were measurable in this individual, although with a maximum signal amplitude 100 times lower compared to sEMG from healthy subjects. The participant was able to voluntarily modulate the required level of muscle activation during the sub-maximal voluntary isometric contractions. Despite the low sEMG amplitude and a considerable level of muscle co-activation, simulations of an elbow orthosis using the measured sEMG as driving signal indicated that the sEMG signals of the participant had the potential to provide control of elbow movements.\nConclusions: To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that sEMG signals from a man with DMD at the last-stage of the disease were measured, analyzed and reported. These findings offer promising perspectives to the use of sEMG as an intuitive and natural control interface for robotic arm supports in adults with DMD until the last stage of the disease."

    "title": "Adaptive Windowing Framework for Surface Electromyogram-Based Pattern Recognition System for Transradial Amputees",
    "abstract": "Electromyogram (EMG)-based Pattern Recognition (PR) systems for upper-limb prosthesis control provide promising ways to enable an intuitive control of the prostheses with multiple degrees of freedom and fast reaction times. However, the lack of robustness of the PR systems may limit their usability. In this paper, a novel adaptive time windowing framework is proposed to enhance the performance of the PR systems by focusing on their windowing and classification steps. The proposed framework estimates the output probabilities of each class and outputs a movement only if a decision with a probability above a certain threshold is achieved. Otherwise (i.e., all probability values are below the threshold), the window size of the EMG signal increases. We demonstrate our framework utilizing EMG datasets collected from nine transradial amputees who performed nine movement classes with Time Domain Power Spectral Descriptors (TD-PSD), Wavelet and Time Domain (TD) feature extraction (FE) methods and a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. Nonetheless, the concept can be applied to other types of features and classifiers. In addition, the proposed framework is validated with different movement and EMG channel combinations. The results indicate that the proposed framework works well with different FE methods and movement/channel combinations with classification error rates of approximately 13% with TD-PSD FE. Thus, we expect our proposed framework to be a straightforward, yet important, step towards the improvement of the control methods for upper-limb prostheses."

    "abstract": "Sudden limb displacement evokes a complex sequence of compensatory muscle activity. Following the short-latency reflex and preceding voluntary reactions is an epoch termed the medium-latency reflex (MLR) that could reflect spinal processing of group II muscle afferents. One way to test this possibility is oral ingestion of tizanidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that inhibits the interneurons transmitting group II signals onto spinal motor neurons. We examined whether group II afferents contribute to MLR activity throughout the major muscles that span the elbow and shoulder. MLRs of ankle muscles were also tested during walking on the same day, in the same participants as well as during sitting in a different group of subjects. In contrast to previous reports, the ingestion of tizanidine had minimal impact on MLRs of arm or leg muscles during motor actions. A significant decrease in magnitude was observed for 2/16 contrasts in arm muscles and 0/4 contrasts in leg muscles. This discrepancy with previous studies could indicate that tizanidine's efficacy is altered by subtle changes in protocol or that group II afferents do not substantially contribute to MLRs."

    "title": "Reward and punishment enhance motor adaptation in stroke",
    "abstract": "Background and objective: The effects of motor learning, such as motor adaptation, in stroke rehabilitation are often transient, thus mandating approaches that enhance the amount of learning and retention. Previously, we showed in young individuals that reward and punishment feedback have dissociable effects on motor adaptation, with punishment improving adaptation and reward enhancing retention. If these findings were able to generalise to patients with stroke, they would provide a way to optimise motor learning in these patients. Therefore, we tested this in 45 patients with chronic stroke allocated in three groups.\nMethods: Patients performed reaching movements with their paretic arm with a robotic manipulandum. After training (day 1), day 2 involved adaptation to a novel force field. During the adaptation phase, patients received performance-based feedback according to the group they were allocated: reward, punishment or no feedback (neutral). On day 3, patients readapted to the force field but all groups now received neutral feedback.\nResults: All patients adapted, with reward and punishment groups displaying greater adaptation and readaptation than the neutral group, irrespective of demographic, cognitive or functional differences. Remarkably, the reward and punishment groups adapted to similar degree as healthy controls. Finally, the reward group showed greater retention.\nConclusions: This study provides, for the first time, evidence that reward and punishment can enhance motor adaptation in patients with stroke. Further research on reinforcement-based motor learning regimes is warranted to translate these promising results into clinical practice and improve motor rehabilitation outcomes in patients with stroke."

    "abstract": "Background: It has been shown that intense training can significantly improve post-stroke upper-limb functionality. However, opportunities for stroke survivors to practice rehabilitation exercises can be limited because of the finite availability of therapists and equipment. This paper presents a haptic-enabled exercise platform intended to assist therapists and moderate-level stroke survivors perform upper-limb reaching motion therapy. This work extends on existing knowledge by presenting: 1) an anthropometrically-inspired design that maximizes elbow and shoulder range of motions during exercise; 2) an unobtrusive upper body postural sensing system; and 3) a vibratory elbow stimulation device to encourage muscle movement.\nMethods: A multi-disciplinary team of professionals were involved in identifying the rehabilitation needs of stroke survivors incorporating these into a prototype device. The prototype system consisted of an exercise device, postural sensors, and a elbow stimulation to encourage the reaching movement. Eight experienced physical and occupational therapists participated in a pilot study exploring the usability of the prototype. Each therapist attended two sessions of one hour each to test and evaluate the proposed system. Feedback about the device was obtained through an administered questionnaire and combined with quantitative data.\nResults: Seven of the nine questions regarding the haptic exercise device scored higher than 3.0 (somewhat good) out of 4.0 (good). The postural sensors detected 93 of 96 (97%) therapist-simulated abnormal postures and correctly ignored 90 of 96 (94%) of normal postures. The elbow stimulation device had a score lower than 2.5 (neutral) for all aspects that were surveyed, however the therapists felt the rehabilitation system was sufficient for use without the elbow stimulation device.\nConclusion: All eight therapists felt the exercise platform could be a good tool to use in upper-limb rehabilitation as the prototype was considered to be generally well designed and capable of delivering reaching task therapy. The next stage of this project is to proceed to clinical trials with stroke patients."

First, we study the kinematics of natural grasp in response to variable interaction forces. We then show simultaneous and independent encoding of kinematic and forces in single unit intra-cortical recordings from sensorimotor cortical areas. Lastly, we demonstrate the relevance of our platform to develop clinically relevant brain computer interfaces in a kinematically unconstrained motor task.\nSignificance: Our versatile control structure does not depend on the specific robotic arm used and allows for the design and implementation of a variety of tasks that can support both fundamental and translational studies of motor control."

Users of hand myoelectric prostheses without tactile feedback must depend essentially on vision to control their device. Indeed, improved tactile feedback is one of their main priorities. Previous research has provided evidence that conveying tactile feedback can improve prostheses control, although additional effort is required to solve problems related to pattern recognition learning, unpleasant sensations, sensory adaptation, and low spatiotemporal resolution. Still, these studies have mainly focused on providing stimulation to hairy skin regions close to the amputation site, i.e., usually to the upper arm. Here, we explored the possibility to provide tactile feedback to the glabrous skin of toes, which have mechanical and neurophysiological properties similar to the fingertips. We explored this paradigm in a grasp-and-lift task, in which healthy participants controlled two opposing digits of a robotic hand by changing the spacing of their index finger and thumb. The normal forces applied by the robotic fingertips to a test object were fed back to the right big and second toe. We show that within a few lifting trials, all the participants incorporated the force feedback received by the foot in their sensorimotor control of the robotic hand."

    "title": "An Alternative Myoelectric Pattern Recognition Approach for the Control of Hand Prostheses: A Case Study of Use in Daily Life by a Dysmelia Subject",
    "abstract": "The functionality of upper limb prostheses can be improved by intuitive control strategies that use bioelectric signals measured at the stump level. One such strategy is the decoding of motor volition via myoelectric pattern recognition (MPR), which has shown promising results in controlled environments and more recently in clinical practice. Moreover, not much has been reported about daily life implementation and real-time accuracy of these decoding algorithms. This paper introduces an alternative approach in which MPR allows intuitive control of four different grips and open/close in a multifunctional prosthetic hand. We conducted a clinical proof-of-concept in activities of daily life by constructing a self-contained, MPR-controlled, transradial prosthetic system provided with a novel user interface meant to log errors during real-time operation. The system was used for five days by a unilateral dysmelia subject whose hand had never developed, and who nevertheless learned to generate patterns of myoelectric activity, reported as intuitive, for multi-functional prosthetic control. The subject was instructed to manually log errors when they occurred via the user interface mounted on the prosthesis. This allowed the collection of information about prosthesis usage and real-time classification accuracy. The assessment of capacity for myoelectric control test was used to compare the proposed approach to the conventional prosthetic control approach, direct control. Regarding the MPR approach, the subject reported a more intuitive control when selecting the different grips, but also a higher uncertainty during proportional continuous movements. This paper represents an alternative to the conventional use of MPR, and this alternative may be particularly suitable for a certain type of amputee patients. Moreover, it represents a further validation of MPR with dysmelia cases."

The purpose of this study was to compare semiautonomous training with T-WREX and conventional semiautonomous exercises that used a tabletop for gravity support.\nMethods: Twenty-eight chronic stroke survivors with moderate/severe hemiparesis were randomly assigned to experimental (T-WREX) or control (tabletop exercise) treatment. A blinded rater assessed arm movement before and after twenty-four 1-hour treatment sessions and at 6-month follow-up. Subjects also rated subjective treatment preferences after a single-session crossover treatment.\nResults: All subjects significantly improved ( P < or = .05) upper extremity motor control (Fugl-Meyer), active reaching range of motion (ROM), and self-reported quality and amount of arm use (Motor Activity Log). Improvements were sustained at 6 months. The T-WREX group maintained gains on the Fugl-Meyer significantly better than controls at 6 months (improvement of 3.6 +/- 3.9 vs 1.5 +/- 2.7 points, mean +/- SD; P = .04). Subjects also reported a preference for T-WREX training.\nConclusion: Gravity-supported arm exercise, using the T-WREX or tabletop support, can improve arm movement ability after chronic severe hemiparesis with brief one-on-one assistance from a therapist (approximately 4 minutes per session). The 3-dimensional weight support, instant visual movement feedback, and simple virtual reality software provided by T-WREX were associated with modest sustained gains at 6-month follow-up when compared with the conventional approach."

    "abstract": "In every country in the world, there are a number of amputees who have been exposed to some accidents that led to the loss of their upper limbs. The aim of this study is to suggest a system for real-time classification of five classes of shoulder girdle motions for high-level upper limb amputees using a pattern recognition system. In the suggested system, the wavelet transform was utilized for feature extraction, and the extreme learning machine was used as a classifier. The system was tested on four intact-limbed subjects and one amputee, with eight channels involving five electromyography channels and three-axis accelerometer sensor. The study shows that the suggested pattern recognition system has the ability to classify the shoulder girdle motions for high-level upper limb motions with 88.4% average classification accuracy for four intact-limbed subjects and 92.8% classification accuracy for one amputee by combining electromyography and accelerometer channels. The outcomes of this study may suggest that the proposed pattern recognition system can help to provide control signals to drive a prosthetic arm for high-level upper limb amputees."

    "title": "Interventions for improving coordination of reach to grasp following stroke: a systematic review",
    "abstract": "Background: Stroke is associated with disruption to efficient and accurate reach to grasp function. Information about treatments for upper limb coordination deficits and their effectiveness may contribute to improved recovery of upper limb function after stroke.\nReview objectives: INCLUSION CRITERIA: We included studies with a specific design objective related to coordination of the hand and arm during reach to grasp and involving participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. The review was inclusive with regard to study design. To determine effectiveness of interventions we analysed studies with coordination measures that exist within impairment measurement scales or specific kinematic measures of coordination.\nSearch strategy: The search included The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; AMED; ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (International) and ISI Proceedings (Conference) databases. A grey literature search included Mednar, Dissertation International, Conference Proceedings, National Institute of Health (NIH) Clinical Trials and the National Institute of Clinical Studies. We also explored PEDro, CSP Research and REHABDATA therapy databases. Finally, the reference lists of identified articles were examined for additional studies. The search spanned from 1950 to April 2010 and was limited to English language papers only.\nCritical appraisal: The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by two independent authors using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Comparable Cohort/ Case Control and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Experimental Studies together with additional questions from Downs and Black DATA EXTRACTION: Two review authors independently extracted data from the studies using standardised JBI-MAStARI data extraction forms.\nData synthesis: Pooling of results was not appropriate so the findings were summarized in tables and in narrative form.\nResults: One RCT, two case control studies and 4 experimental studies without controls were included in this review. The review has identified three categories of potential interventions for improving hand and arm coordination after stroke; functional therapy, biofeedback or electrical stimulation and robot or computerised training. In view of the limited availability of good quality evidence and lack of empirical data this review does not draw a definitive conclusion for the second question regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving hand and arm coordination after stroke. Improvements in hand and arm coordination during reach to grasp were reported in 4 studies, whereas one study found no benefit. Two studies did not report specific effects of interventions for hand and arm coordination after stroke.\nConclusions: There is currently insufficient evidence to provide strong recommendations about the effect of interventions for improving hand and arm coordination during reach to grasp after stroke.Consensus regarding outcome measures for evaluating the effects of interventions on hand and arm coordination should be established. RCTs with good methodological quality, using standardized outcome measures would enable meta-analysis comparison in the future. Studies which monitor functional performance together with detailed kinematic measures of hand and arm coordination over time would help evaluate levels of recovery and compensation after stroke."

    "title": "SITAR: a system for independent task-oriented assessment and rehabilitation",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Over recent years, task-oriented training has emerged as a dominant approach in neurorehabilitation. This article presents a novel, sensor-based system for independent task-oriented assessment and rehabilitation (SITAR) of the upper limb.\nMethods: The SITAR is an ecosystem of interactive devices including a touch and force-sensitive tabletop and a set of intelligent objects enabling functional interaction. In contrast to most existing sensor-based systems, SITAR provides natural training of visuomotor coordination through collocated visual and haptic workspaces alongside multimodal feedback, facilitating learning and its transfer to real tasks. We illustrate the possibilities offered by the SITAR for sensorimotor assessment and therapy through pilot assessment and usability studies.\nResults: The pilot data from the assessment study demonstrates how the system can be used to assess different aspects of upper limb reaching, pick-and-place and sensory tactile resolution tasks. The pilot usability study indicates that patients are able to train arm-reaching movements independently using the SITAR with minimal involvement of the therapist and that they were motivated to pursue the SITAR-based therapy.\nConclusion: SITAR is a versatile, non-robotic tool that can be used to implement a range of therapeutic exercises and assessments for different types of patients, which is particularly well-suited for task-oriented training."

    "abstract": "Purpose: To determine the clinical feasibility of a system based on augmented reality for upper-limb (UL) motor rehabilitation of stroke participants.\nMethod: A physiotherapist instructed the participants to accomplish tasks in augmented reality environment, where they could see themselves and their surroundings, as in a mirror. Two case studies were conducted. Participants were evaluated pre- and post-intervention. The first study evaluated the UL motor function using Fugl-Meyer scale. Data were compared using non-parametric sign tests and effect size. The second study used the gain of motion range of shoulder flexion and abduction assessed by computerized biophotogrammetry.\nResults: At a significance level of 5%, Fugl-Meyer scores suggested a trend for greater UL motor improvement in the augmented reality group than in the other. Moreover, effect size value 0.86 suggested high practical significance for UL motor rehabilitation using the augmented reality system.\nConclusion: System provided promising results for UL motor rehabilitation, since enhancements have been observed in the shoulder range of motion and speed. Implications for Rehabilitation Gain of range of motion of flexion and abduction of the shoulder of post-stroke patients can be achieved through an augmented reality system containing exercises to promote the mental practice. NeuroR system provides a mental practice method combined with visual feedback for motor rehabilitation of chronic stroke patients, giving the illusion of injured upper-limb (UL) movements while the affected UL is resting. Its application is feasible and safe. This system can be used to improve UL rehabilitation, an additional treatment past the traditional period of the stroke patient hospitalization and rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "Haptic feedback to lower limb amputees is essential to maximize the functionality of a prosthetic device by providing information to the user about the interaction with the environment and the position of the prostheses in space. Severed sensory pathway and the absence of connection between the prosthesis and the Central Nervous System (CNS) after lower limb amputation reduces balance control, increases visual dependency and increases risk of falls among amputees. This work describes the design of a wearable haptic feedback device for lower limb amputees using lateral skin-stretch modality intended to serve as a feedback cue during ambulation. A feedback scheme was proposed based on gait event detection for possible real-time postural adjustment. Preliminary perceptual test with healthy subjects in static condition was carried out and the results indicated over 98% accuracy in determining stimuli location around the upper leg region, suggesting good perceptibility of the delivered stimuli."

Seventeen stroke survivors with residual upper limb weakness, and seven healthcare professionals with expertise in stroke rehabilitation, were enrolled in the user-centered design process. Through semi-structured interviews, they provided feedback on the hardware, software and impact of a home-based rehabilitation device to facilitate self-managed arm exercise. Members of the multidisciplinary clinical and engineering research team, based on previous experience and existing literature in user-centred design, developed the topic list for the interviews. Meaningful concepts were extracted from participants' interviews based on existing ICF linking rules and matched to categories within the ICF Comprehensive Core Set for stroke. Most of the interview concepts (except personal factors) matched the existing ICF Comprehensive Core Set categories. Personal factors that emerged from interviews e.g. gender, age, interest, compliance, motivation, choice and convenience that might determine device usability are yet to be categorised within the ICF framework and hence could not be matched to a specific Core Set category."

    "abstract": "We propose an approach for online simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control of two degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of the wrist, using surface electromyographic signals. The method is based on the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) of the wrist muscle activation to extract low-dimensional control signals translated by the user into kinematic variables. This procedure does not need a training set of signals for which the kinematics is known (labeled dataset) and is thus unsupervised (although it requires an initial calibration without labeled signals). The estimated control signals using NMF are used to directly control two DoFs of wrist. The method was tested on seven subjects with upper limb deficiency and on seven able-bodied subjects. The subjects performed online control of a virtual object with two DoFs to achieve goal-oriented tasks. The performance of the two subject groups, measured as the task completion rate, task completion time, and execution efficiency, was not statistically different. The approach was compared, and demonstrated to be superior to the online control by the industrial state-of-the-art approach. These results show that this new approach, which has several advantages over the previous myoelectric prosthetic control systems, has the potential of providing intuitive and dexterous control of artificial limbs for amputees."

    "title": "Effect of task-related continuous auditory feedback during learning of tracking motion exercises",
    "abstract": "Background: This paper presents the results of a set of experiments in which we used continuous auditory feedback to augment motor training exercises. This feedback modality is mostly underexploited in current robotic rehabilitation systems, which usually implement only very basic auditory interfaces. Our hypothesis is that properly designed continuous auditory feedback could be used to represent temporal and spatial information that could in turn, improve performance and motor learning.\nMethods: We implemented three different experiments on healthy subjects, who were asked to track a target on a screen by moving an input device (controller) with their hand. Different visual and auditory feedback modalities were envisaged. The first experiment investigated whether continuous task-related auditory feedback can help improve performance to a greater extent than error-related audio feedback, or visual feedback alone. In the second experiment we used sensory substitution to compare different types of auditory feedback with equivalent visual feedback, in order to find out whether mapping the same information on a different sensory channel (the visual channel) yielded comparable effects with those gained in the first experiment. The final experiment applied a continuously changing visuomotor transformation between the controller and the screen and mapped kinematic information, computed in either coordinate system (controller or video), to the audio channel, in order to investigate which information was more relevant to the user.\nResults: Task-related audio feedback significantly improved performance with respect to visual feedback alone, whilst error-related feedback did not. Secondly, performance in audio tasks was significantly better with respect to the equivalent sensory-substituted visual tasks. Finally, with respect to visual feedback alone, video-task-related sound feedback decreased the tracking error during the learning of a novel visuomotor perturbation, whereas controller-task-related sound feedback did not. This result was particularly interesting, as the subjects relied more on auditory augmentation of the visualized target motion (which was altered with respect to arm motion by the visuomotor perturbation), rather than on sound feedback provided in the controller space, i.e., information directly related to the effective target motion of their arm.\nConclusions: Our results indicate that auditory augmentation of visual feedback can be beneficial during the execution of upper limb movement exercises. In particular, we found that continuous task-related information provided through sound, in addition to visual feedback can improve not only performance but also the learning of a novel visuomotor perturbation. However, error-related information provided through sound did not improve performance and negatively affected learning in the presence of the visuomotor perturbation."

    "title": "The SmartHand transradial prosthesis",
    "abstract": "Background: Prosthetic components and control interfaces for upper limb amputees have barely changed in the past 40 years. Many transradial prostheses have been developed in the past, nonetheless most of them would be inappropriate if/when a large bandwidth human-machine interface for control and perception would be available, due to either their limited (or inexistent) sensorization or limited dexterity. SmartHand tackles this issue as is meant to be clinically experimented in amputees employing different neuro-interfaces, in order to investigate their effectiveness. This paper presents the design and on bench evaluation of the SmartHand.\nMethods: SmartHand design was bio-inspired in terms of its physical appearance, kinematics, sensorization, and its multilevel control system. Underactuated fingers and differential mechanisms were designed and exploited in order to fit all mechatronic components in the size and weight of a natural human hand. Its sensory system was designed with the aim of delivering significant afferent information to the user through adequate interfaces.\nResults: SmartHand is a five fingered self-contained robotic hand, with 16 degrees of freedom, actuated by 4 motors. It integrates a bio-inspired sensory system composed of 40 proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors and a customized embedded controller both employed for implementing automatic grasp control and for potentially delivering sensory feedback to the amputee. It is able to perform everyday grasps, count and independently point the index. The weight (530 g) and speed (closing time: 1.5 seconds) are comparable to actual commercial prostheses. It is able to lift a 10 kg suitcase; slippage tests showed that within particular friction and geometric conditions the hand is able to stably grasp up to 3.6 kg cylindrical objects.\nConclusions: Due to its unique embedded features and human-size, the SmartHand holds the promise to be experimentally fitted on transradial amputees and employed as a bi-directional instrument for investigating -during realistic experiments- different interfaces, control and feedback strategies in neuro-engineering studies."

    "title": "Neural correlates of the rubber hand illusion in amputees: a report of two cases",
    "abstract": "One of the current challenges in the field of advanced prosthetics is the development of artificial limbs that provide the user with detailed sensory feedback. Sensory feedback from our limbs is not only important for proprioceptive awareness and motor control, but also essential for providing us with a feeling of ownership or simply put, the sensation that our limbs actually belong to ourselves. The strong link between sensory feedback and ownership has been repeatedly demonstrated with the so-called rubber hand illusion (RHI), during which individuals are induced with the illusory sensation that an artificial hand is their own. In healthy participants, this occurs via integration of visual and tactile signals, which is primarily supported by multisensory regions in premotor and intraparietal cortices. Here, we describe a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with two upper limb amputees, showing for the first time that the same brain regions underlie ownership sensations of an artificial hand in this population. Albeit preliminary, these findings are interesting from both a theoretical as well as a clinical point of view. From a theoretical perspective, they imply that even years after the amputation, a few seconds of synchronous visuotactile stimulation are sufficient to activate hand-centered multisensory integration mechanisms. From a clinical perspective, they show that a very basic sensation of touch from an artificial hand can be obtained by simple but precisely targeted stimulation of the stump, and suggest that a similar mechanism implemented in prosthetic hands would greatly facilitate ownership sensations and in turn, acceptance of the prosthesis."

    "title": "Predictors and brain connectivity changes associated with arm motor function improvement from intensive practice in chronic stroke",
    "abstract": "Background and Purpose: The brain changes that underlie therapy-induced improvement in motor function after stroke remain obscure. This study sought to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of measuring motor system physiology in a clinical trial of intensive upper extremity rehabilitation in chronic stroke-related hemiparesis. Methods: This was a substudy of two multi-center clinical trials of intensive robotic and intensive conventional therapy arm therapy in chronic, significantly hemiparetic, stroke patients. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to measure motor cortical output to the biceps and extensor digitorum communus muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to determine the cortical anatomy, as well as to measure fractional anisotropy, and blood oxygenation (BOLD) during an eyes-closed rest state. Region-of-interest time-series correlation analysis was performed on the BOLD signal to determine interregional connectivity. Functional status was measured with the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer and Wolf Motor Function Test. Results: Motor evoked potential (MEP) presence was associated with better functional outcomes, but the effect was not significant when considering baseline impairment. Affected side internal capsule fractional anisotropy was associated with better function at baseline. Affected side primary motor cortex (M1) activity became more correlated with other frontal motor regions after treatment. Resting state connectivity between affected hemisphere M1 and dorsal premotor area (PMAd) predicted recovery. Conclusions: Presence of motor evoked potentials in the affected motor cortex and its functional connectivity with PMAd may be useful in predicting recovery. Functional connectivity in the motor network shows a trends towards increasing after intensive robotic or non-robotic arm therapy. Clinical Trial Registration URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

    "title": "Feature Extraction of Shoulder Joint's Voluntary Flexion-Extension Movement Based on Electroencephalography Signals for Power Assistance",
    "abstract": "Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) has been considered as an effective way to help and support both the disabled rehabilitation and healthy individuals' daily lives to use their brain activity information instead of their bodies. In order to reduce costs and control exoskeleton robots better, we aim to estimate the necessary torque information for a subject from his/her electroencephalography (EEG) signals when using an exoskeleton robot to perform the power assistance of the upper limb without using external torque sensors nor electromyography (EMG) sensors. In this paper, we focus on extracting the motion-relevant EEG signals' features of the shoulder joint, which is the most complex joint in the human's body, to construct a power assistance system using wearable upper limb exoskeleton robots with BMI technology. We extract the characteristic EEG signals when the shoulder joint is doing flexion and extension movement freely which are the main motions of the shoulder joint needed to be assisted. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to extract the source information of neural components, and then the average method is used to extract the characteristic signals that are fundamental to achieve the control. The proposed approach has been experimentally verified. The results show that EEG signals begin to increase at 300⁻400 ms before the motion and then decrease at the beginning of the generation of EMG signals, and the peaks appear at about one second after the motion. At the same time, we also confirmed the relationship between the change of EMG signals and the EEG signals on the time dimension, and these results also provide a theoretical basis for the delay parameter in the linear model which will be used to estimate the necessary torque information in future. Our results suggest that the estimation of torque information based on EEG signals is feasible, and demonstrate the potential of using EEG signals via the control of brain-machine interface to support human activities continuously."

    "abstract": "Proprioception is a critical component for motor functions and directly affects motor learning after neurological injuries. Conventional methods for its assessment are generally ordinal in nature and hence lack sensitivity. Robotic devices designed to promote sensorimotor learning can potentially provide quantitative precise, accurate, and reliable assessments of sensory impairments. In this paper, we investigate the clinical applicability and validity of using a planar 2 degrees of freedom robot to quantitatively assess proprioceptive deficits in post-stroke participants. Nine stroke survivors and nine healthy subjects participated in the study. Participants' hand was passively moved to the target position guided by the H-Man robot (Criterion movement) and were asked to indicate during a second passive movement towards the same target (Matching movement) when they felt that they matched the target position. The assessment was carried out on a planar surface for movements in the forward and oblique directions in the contralateral and ipsilateral sides of the tested arm. The matching performance was evaluated in terms of error magnitude (absolute and signed) and its variability. Stroke patients showed higher variability in the estimation of the target position compared to the healthy participants. Further, an effect of target was found, with lower absolute errors in the contralateral side. Pairwise comparison between individual stroke participant and control participants showed significant proprioceptive deficits in two patients. The proposed assessment of passive joint position sense was inherently simple and all participants, regardless of motor impairment level, could complete it in less than 10 minutes. Therefore, the method can potentially be carried out to detect changes in proprioceptive deficits in clinical settings."

    "abstract": "Electromyography (EMG), the measurement of electrical muscle activity, is used in a variety of applications, including myoelectric upper-limb prostheses, which help amputees to regain independence and a higher quality of life. The state-of-the-art sensors in prostheses have a conductive connection to the skin and are therefore sensitive to sweat and require preparation of the skin. They are applied with some pressure to ensure a conductive connection, which may result in pressure marks and can be problematic for patients with circulatory disorders, who constitute a major group of amputees. Due to their insulating layer between skin and sensor area, capacitive sensors are insensitive to the skin condition, they require neither conductive connection to the skin nor electrolytic paste or skin preparation. Here, we describe a highly stable, low-power capacitive EMG measurement set-up that is suitable for real-world application. Various flexible multi-layer sensor set-ups made of copper and insulating foils, flex print and textiles were compared. These flexible sensor set-ups adapt to the anatomy of the human forearm, therefore they provide high wearing comfort and ensure stability against motion artifacts. The influence of the materials used in the sensor set-up on the magnitude of the coupled signal was demonstrated based on both theoretical analysis and measurement.The amplifier circuit was optimized for high signal quality, low power consumption and mobile application. Different shielding and guarding concepts were compared, leading to high SNR."

    "title": "Restoring the sense of touch with a prosthetic hand through a brain interface",
    "abstract": "Our ability to manipulate objects dexterously relies fundamentally on sensory signals originating from the hand. To restore motor function with upper-limb neuroprostheses requires that somatosensory feedback be provided to the tetraplegic patient or amputee. Given the complexity of state-of-the-art prosthetic limbs and, thus, the huge state space they can traverse, it is desirable to minimize the need for the patient to learn associations between events impinging on the limb and arbitrary sensations. Accordingly, we have developed approaches to intuitively convey sensory information that is critical for object manipulation--information about contact location, pressure, and timing--through intracortical microstimulation of primary somatosensory cortex. In experiments with nonhuman primates, we show that we can elicit percepts that are projected to a localized patch of skin and that track the pressure exerted on the skin. In a real-time application, we demonstrate that animals can perform a tactile discrimination task equally well whether mechanical stimuli are delivered to their native fingers or to a prosthetic one. Finally, we propose that the timing of contact events can be signaled through phasic intracortical microstimulation at the onset and offset of object contact that mimics the ubiquitous on and off responses observed in primary somatosensory cortex to complement slowly varying pressure-related feedback. We anticipate that the proposed biomimetic feedback will considerably increase the dexterity and embodiment of upper-limb neuroprostheses and will constitute an important step in restoring touch to individuals who have lost it."

    "abstract": "At least 90% of individuals of limb amputees experience phantom limb pain (PLP). Recent clinical research suggests that providing patients with the mirror image representation of the amputated limb may alleviate PLP. However, mirror therapy cannot be used with bilateral amputees, as visual feedback is dependent on the movement of the intact limb. To overcome this limitation, we designed a novel myoelectric-controlled virtual reality (VR) system for the treatment of phantom limb pain in trans-radial upper extremity amputees. The proposed system allows the patient to directly control the virtual limb by recognizing stump muscle patterns recorded with EMG sensors. The hypothesis behind this strategy is that the VR image of the amputated limb induces better limb imagery than the reflected image of their intact limb and, therefore, is more effective in reducing PLP. A research protocol to test this hypothesis is described."

    "abstract": "Humans have the remarkable ability to hold, grasp, and manipulate objects. Previous work has reported rapid and coordinated reactions in hand and shoulder muscles in response to external perturbations to the arm during object manipulation; however, little is known about how somatosensory feedback of an object slipping in the hand influences responses of the arm. We built a handheld device to stimulate the sensation of slipping at all five fingertips. The device was integrated into an exoskeleton robot that supported it against gravity. The setup allowed us to decouple somatosensory stimulation in the fingers from forces applied to the arm, two variables that are highly interdependent in real-world scenarios. Fourteen participants performed three experiments in which we measured their arm feedback responses during slip stimulation. Slip stimulations were applied horizontally in one of two directions, and participants were instructed to either follow the slip direction or move the arm in the opposite direction. Participants showed shoulder muscle responses within ∼67 ms of slip onset when following the direction of slip but significantly slower responses when instructed to move in the opposite direction. Shoulder responses were modulated by the speed but not the distance of the slip. Finally, when slip stimulation was combined with mechanical perturbations to the arm, we found that sensory information from the fingertips significantly modulated the shoulder feedback responses. Overall, the results demonstrate the existence of a rapid feedback system that stabilizes handheld objects.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We tested whether the sensation of an object slipping from the fingers modulates shoulder feedback responses. We found rapid shoulder feedback responses when participants were instructed to follow the slip direction with the arm. Shoulder responses following mechanical joint perturbations were also potentiated when combined with slipping. These results demonstrate the existence of fast and automatic feedback responses in the arm in reaction to sensory input to the fingertips that maintain grip on handheld objects."

Patients might drop out of training because the rehabilitation process is long and often discouraging. Game-based interventions provide a potentially useful alternative to standard myoelectric (electromyographic [EMG]) training and can increase engagement with training.\nObjective: To assess the short-term impact of a game-based rehabilitation protocol on parameters for EMG control, evaluate how game-based interventions affect patient motivation, performance, and effort, and compare the game-based intervention with a standard tool in rehabilitation (MyoBoy).\nDesign: This randomized controlled trial included 2 patient groups and 1 control group. After establishing a baseline, the 2 patient groups received different interventions that were compared with each other and with the able-bodied control group.\nSetting: University hospital-based study.\nParticipants: Fourteen patients with traumatic transradial or transhumeral upper extremity amputation and 10 able-bodied participants.\nMethods: For the game-based intervention, EMG proficiency was assessed before and after playing the games and 2 days later as follow-up to measure retention rate. EMG proficiency was measured using maximum voluntary contraction, proportional precision control, signal separation, and muscle endurance. Questionnaires for rating the game-based intervention and intrinsic motivation were provided after the intervention.\nOutcomes: Outcome measures for EMG proficiency were provisional maximum voluntary muscle contraction, precise proportional control, electrode separation, and muscle endurance. Quantitative outcome measures for participant experience were intrinsic motivation, enjoyment, pressure, exerted effort, and usefulness of the intervention. The qualitative outcome measure was the surveyed attitude toward the game-based intervention.\nResults: Results showed an overall improvement in EMG control, fine muscle activation, and electrode separation. Patients stated that racing games provided slightly more fun, but rhythm-based games were considered to provide better challenges for EMG control.\nConclusion: Game-based interventions provide a useful addition to standard EMG training and can achieve better results in clinical outcome measures. The racing and music game genres provide solid starting points for interventions. Further studies can look at a wider range of genres and identify more specific game mechanics suitable for training.\nLevel of evidence: I."

The design change also required a modification of the implantation method. Mechanical and in vivo testing was performed on the novel components of the electrode. The first clinical application also is described.\nResults: The electrode design modifications did not create any areas of excess mechanical strain on the wires at the distal end where the leads were wound into electrode surfaces. In vivo testing showed that the IM-MES electrode recorded myoelectric signals that were equivalent to an existing epimysial MES electrode. The modified implantation method was simple to implement. The IM-MES electrode was used in an upper extremity FES system in an individual with a spinal cord injury and provided signals that were suitable for a command signal.\nConclusions: A fully implanted, bipolar intramuscular recording electrode (IM-MES) was developed. Implantation of the IM-MES is straightforward, and almost any muscle can be targeted. Testing has been performed to demonstrate the suitability of the IM-MES electrode for clinical use.

    "abstract": "The appropriate sensory information feedback is important for the success of an object grasping and manipulation task. In many scenarios, the need arises for multiple feedback information to be conveyed to a prosthetic hand user simultaneously. The multiple sets of information may either (1) directly contribute to the performance of the grasping or object manipulation task, such as the feedback of the grasping force, or (2) simply form additional independent set(s) of information. In this paper, the efficacy of simultaneously conveying two independent sets of sensor information (the grasp force and a secondary set of information) through a single channel of feedback stimulation (vibrotactile via bone conduction) to the human user in a prosthetic application is investigated. The performance of the grasping task is not dependent to the second set of information in this study. Subject performance in two tasks: regulating the grasp force and identifying the secondary information, were evaluated when provided with either one corresponding information or both sets of feedback information. Visual feedback is involved in the training stage. The proposed approach is validated on human-subject experiments using a vibrotactile transducer worn on the elbow bony landmark (to realize a non-invasive bone conduction interface) carried out in a virtual reality environment to perform a closed-loop object grasping task. The experimental results show that the performance of the human subjects on either task, whilst perceiving two sets of sensory information, is not inferior to that when receiving only one set of corresponding sensory information, demonstrating the potential of conveying a second set of information through a bone conduction interface in an upper limb prosthetic task."

    "abstract": "Tactile sensation is critical for effective object manipulation, but current prosthetic upper limbs make no provision for delivering somesthetic feedback to the user. For individuals who require use of prosthetic limbs, this lack of feedback transforms a mundane task into one that requires extreme concentration and effort. Although vibrotactile motors and sensory substitution devices can be used to convey gross sensations, a direct neural interface is required to provide detailed and intuitive sensory feedback. In light of this, we describe the implementation of a somatosensory prosthesis with which we elicit, through intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), percepts whose magnitude is graded according to the force exerted on the prosthetic finger. Specifically, the prosthesis consists of a sensorized finger, the force output of which is converted into a regime of ICMS delivered to primary somatosensory cortex through chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays. We show that the performance of animals (Rhesus macaques) on a tactile task is equivalent whether stimuli are delivered to the native finger or to the prosthetic finger."

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have been shown to be a promising tool in rehabilitation and assistive scenarios. Within these contexts, brain signals can be decoded and used as commands for a robotic device, allowing to translate user's intentions into motor actions in order to support the user's impaired neuro-muscular system. Recently, it has been suggested that slow cortical potentials (SCPs), negative deflections in the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals peaking around one second before the initiation of movements, might be of interest because they offer an accurate time resolution for the provided feedback. Many state-of-the-art studies exploiting SCPs have focused on decoding intention of movements related to walking and arm reaching, but up to now few studies have focused on decoding the intention to grasp, which is of fundamental importance in upper-limb tasks. In this work, we present a technique that exploits EEG to decode grasping correlates during reaching movements. Results obtained with four subjects show the existence of SCPs prior to the execution of grasping movements and how they can be used to classify, with accuracy rates greater than 70% across all subjects, the intention to grasp. Using a sliding window approach, we have also demonstrated how this intention can be decoded on average around 400 ms before the grasp movements for two out of four subjects, and after the onset of grasp itself for the two other subjects."

    "abstract": "The role of the mechanical properties of the neuromuscular system in motor control has been investigated for a long time in both human and animal subjects, mainly through the application of mechanical perturbations to the limb during natural movements and the observation of its corrective responses. These methods have provided a wealth of insight into how the central nervous system controls the limb. They suffer, however, from the fact that it is almost impossible to separate the active and passive components of the measured arm stiffness and that the measurement may themselves alter the stiffness characteristic of the arm. As a complement to these analyses, the implementation of a given neuroscientific hypothesis on a real mechanical system could overcome these measurement artifact and provide a tool that is, under full control of the experimenter, able to replicate the relevant functional features of the human arm. In this article, we introduce the NEURARM platform, a robotic arm intended to test hypotheses on the human motor control system. As such, NEURARM satisfies two key requirements. First, its kinematic parameters and inertia are similar to that of the human arm. Second, NEURARM mimics the main physical features of the human actuation system, specifically, the use of tendons to transfer force, the presence of antagonistic muscle pairs, the passive elasticity of muscles in the absence of any neural feedback and the non-linear elastic behaviour. This article presents the design and characterization of the NEURARM actuation system. The resulting mechanical behaviour, which has been tested in joint and Cartesian space under static and dynamic conditions, proves that the NEURARM platform can be exploited as a robotic model of the human arm, and could thus represent a powerful tool for neuroscience investigations."

    "title": "A Modular Transradial Bypass Socket for Surface Myoelectric Prosthetic Control in Non-Amputees",
    "abstract": "Bypass sockets allow researchers to perform tests of prosthetic systems from the prosthetic user's perspective. We designed a modular upper-limb bypass socket with 3D-printed components that can be easily modified for use with a variety of terminal devices. Our bypass socket preserves access to forearm musculature and the hand, which are necessary for surface electromyography and to provide substituted sensory feedback. Our bypass socket allows a sufficient range of motion to complete tasks in the frontal working area, as measured on non-amputee participants. We examined the performance of non-amputee participants using the bypass socket on the original and modified Box and Block Tests. Participants moved 11.3 ± 2.7 and 11.7 ± 2.4 blocks in the original and modified Box and Block Tests (mean ± SD), respectively, within the range of reported scores using amputee participants. Range of motion for users wearing the bypass socket meets or exceeds most reported range of motion requirements for activities of daily living. The bypass socket was originally designed with a freely rotating wrist; we found that adding elastic resistance to user wrist rotation while wearing the bypass socket had no significant effect on motor decode performance. We have open-sourced the design files and an assembly manual for the bypass socket. We anticipate that the bypass socket will be a useful tool to evaluate and develop sensorized myoelectric prosthesis technology."

    "title": "Using Virtual Reality to Transfer Motor Skill Knowledge from One Hand to Another",
    "abstract": "As far as acquiring motor skills is concerned, training by voluntary physical movement is superior to all other forms of training (e.g. training by observation or passive movement of trainee's hands by a robotic device). This obviously presents a major challenge in the rehabilitation of a paretic limb since voluntary control of physical movement is limited. Here, we describe a novel training scheme we have developed that has the potential to circumvent this major challenge. We exploited the voluntary control of one hand and provided real-time movement-based manipulated sensory feedback as if the other hand is moving. Visual manipulation through virtual reality (VR) was combined with a device that yokes left-hand fingers to passively follow right-hand voluntary finger movements. In healthy subjects, we demonstrate enhanced within-session performance gains of a limb in the absence of voluntary physical training. Results in healthy subjects suggest that training with the unique VR setup might also be beneficial for patients with upper limb hemiparesis by exploiting the voluntary control of their healthy hand to improve rehabilitation of their affected hand."

    "title": "Propriospinal transmission of part of the corticospinal excitation in humans",
    "abstract": "In humans a substantial part of corticospinal excitation to upper limb motoneurons is mediated through cervical premotoneurons located rostral to motoneurons, analogous to the feline system of C3-C4 propriospinal neurons. The indirect (disynaptic) component of the corticospinal command passing through the propriospinal relay may be updated by the extensive convergence at this level of afferent inputs (both excitatory and inhibitory) from the moving limb. Propriospinal neurons are potently inhibited by feedback inhibitory interneurons facilitated from the motor cortex, and this explains why artificial volleys delivered to the pyramidal system by itself have failed to demonstrate this indirect corticospinal projection. The strength of this indirect corticospinal projection may be estimated in routine practice by the amount of suppression elicited by a cutaneous volley on the ongoing electromyogram of extensor carpi radialis, and is increased in patients recovering from hemiplegia and in early Parkinson's disease."

    "title": "Using Functional Electrical Stimulation Mediated by Iterative Learning Control and Robotics to Improve Arm Movement for People With Multiple Sclerosis",
    "abstract": "Few interventions address multiple sclerosis (MS) arm dysfunction but robotics and functional electrical stimulation (FES) appear promising. This paper investigates the feasibility of combining FES with passive robotic support during virtual reality (VR) training tasks to improve upper limb function in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). The system assists patients in following a specified trajectory path, employing an advanced model-based paradigm termed iterative learning control (ILC) to adjust the FES to improve accuracy and maximise voluntary effort. Reaching tasks were repeated six times with ILC learning the optimum control action from previous attempts. A convenience sample of five pwMS was recruited from local MS societies, and the intervention comprised 18 one-hour training sessions over 10 weeks. The accuracy of tracking performance without FES and the amount of FES delivered during training were analyzed using regression analysis. Clinical functioning of the arm was documented before and after treatment with standard tests. Statistically significant results following training included: improved accuracy of tracking performance both when assisted and unassisted by FES; reduction in maximum amount of FES needed to assist tracking; and less impairment in the proximal arm that was trained. The system was well tolerated by all participants with no increase in muscle fatigue reported. This study confirms the feasibility of FES combined with passive robot assistance as a potentially effective intervention to improve arm movement and control in pwMS and provides the basis for a follow-up study."

    "abstract": "Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) have the potential to assist in the rehabilitation of millions of patients worldwide. Despite recent advancements in BMI technology for the restoration of lost motor function, a training environment to restore full control of the anatomical segments of an upper limb extremity has not yet been presented. Here, we develop a virtual upper limb prosthesis with 27 independent dimensions, the anatomical dimensions of the human arm and hand, and deploy the virtual prosthesis as an avatar in a virtual reality environment (VRE) that can be controlled in real-time. The prosthesis avatar accepts kinematic control inputs that can be captured from movements of the arm and hand as well as neural control inputs derived from processed neural signals. We characterize the system performance under kinematic control using a commercially available motion capture system. We also present the performance under kinematic control achieved by two non-human primates (Macaca Mulatta) trained to use the prosthetic avatar to perform reaching and grasping tasks. This is the first virtual prosthetic device that is capable of emulating all the anatomical movements of a healthy upper limb in real-time. Since the system accepts both neural and kinematic inputs for a variety of many-dimensional skeletons, we propose it provides a customizable training platform for the acquisition of many-dimensional neural prosthetic control."

    "title": "Quantitative EEG for Predicting Upper Limb Motor Recovery in Chronic Stroke Robot-Assisted Rehabilitation",
    "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause for adult disability, which in many cases causes motor deficits. Despite the developments in motor rehabilitation techniques, recovery of upper limb functions after stroke is limited and heterogeneous in terms of outcomes, and knowledge of important factors that may affect the outcome of the therapy is necessary to make a reasonable prediction for individual patients. In this paper, we assessed the relationship between quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) measures and the motor outcome in chronic stroke patients that underwent a robot-assisted rehabilitation program to evaluate the utility of QEEG indices to predict motor recovery. For this purpose, we acquired resting-state electroencephalographic signals from which the power ratio index (PRI), delta/alpha ratio, and brain symmetry index were calculated. The outcome of the motor rehabilitation was evaluated using upper limb section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment. We found that PRI was significantly correlated with the motor recovery, suggesting that this index may provide useful information to predict the rehabilitation outcome."

    "title": "A biologically inspired neural network controller for ballistic arm movements",
    "abstract": "Background: In humans, the implementation of multijoint tasks of the arm implies a highly complex integration of sensory information, sensorimotor transformations and motor planning. Computational models can be profitably used to better understand the mechanisms sub-serving motor control, thus providing useful perspectives and investigating different control hypotheses. To this purpose, the use of Artificial Neural Networks has been proposed to represent and interpret the movement of upper limb. In this paper, a neural network approach to the modelling of the motor control of a human arm during planar ballistic movements is presented.\nMethods: The developed system is composed of three main computational blocks: 1) a parallel distributed learning scheme that aims at simulating the internal inverse model in the trajectory formation process; 2) a pulse generator, which is responsible for the creation of muscular synergies; and 3) a limb model based on two joints (two degrees of freedom) and six muscle-like actuators, that can accommodate for the biomechanical parameters of the arm. The learning paradigm of the neural controller is based on a pure exploration of the working space with no feedback signal. Kinematics provided by the system have been compared with those obtained in literature from experimental data of humans.\nResults: The model reproduces kinematics of arm movements, with bell-shaped wrist velocity profiles and approximately straight trajectories, and gives rise to the generation of synergies for the execution of movements. The model allows achieving amplitude and direction errors of respectively 0.52 cm and 0.2 radians. Curvature values are similar to those encountered in experimental measures with humans. The neural controller also manages environmental modifications such as the insertion of different force fields acting on the end-effector.\nConclusion: The proposed system has been shown to properly simulate the development of internal models and to control the generation and execution of ballistic planar arm movements. Since the neural controller learns to manage movements on the basis of kinematic information and arm characteristics, it could in perspective command a neuroprosthesis instead of a biomechanical model of a human upper limb, and it could thus give rise to novel rehabilitation techniques."

    "abstract": "This paper presents two robot devices for use in the rehabilitation of upper limb movements and reports the quantitative parameters obtained to characterize the rate of improvement, thus allowing a precise monitoring of patient's recovery. A one degree of freedom (DoF) wrist manipulator and a two-DoF elbow-shoulder manipulator were designed using an admittance control strategy; if the patient could not move the handle, the devices completed the motor task. Two groups of chronic post-stroke patients (G1 n = 7, and G2 n = 9) were enrolled in a three week rehabilitation program including standard physical therapy (45 min daily) plus treatment by means of robot devices, respectively, for wrist and elbow-shoulder movements (40 min, twice daily). Both groups were evaluated by means of standard clinical assessment scales and a new robot measured evaluation metrics that included an active movement index quantifying the patient's ability to execute the assigned motor task without robot assistance, the mean velocity, and a movement accuracy index measuring the distance of the executed path from the theoretic one. After treatment, both groups improved their motor deficit and disability. In G1, there was a significant change in the clinical scale values (p < 0.05) and range of motion wrist extension (p < 0.02). G2 showed a significant change in clinical scales (p < 0.01), in strength (p < 0.05) and in the robot measured parameters (p < 0.01). The relationship between robot measured parameters and the clinical assessment scales showed a moderate and significant correlation (r > 0.53 p < 0.03). Our findings suggest that robot-aided neurorehabilitation may improve the motor outcome and disability of chronic post-stroke patients. The new robot measured parameters may provide useful information about the course of treatment and its effectiveness at discharge."

    "title": "[Smart Rehab: App-based rehabilitation training for upper extremity amputees - Case Report]",
    "abstract": "Background: Control of a myoelectric prostheses entails rehabilitative training, based on repetitive exercises with a physiotherapist. However, many patients lack the motivation to continue the exercises in their home environment. Mobile games on the smartphone can provide patients with long-term motivation to continue the repetitive exercises that prepare the muscles for controlling a prosthesis at home. The aim of this study was to confirm the feasibility of a myoelectrical controlled mobile application and the impact of this game-based rehabilitation on the patient's maximum voluntary contraction strength, proportionally activated muscle contraction and ability to separate muscle groups.\nPatients and methods: We developed a training system that consisted of a game-based mobile rehabilitation application that is controlled by the patient's muscle signal, a tablet to play on, an electrode armband and a manual. So far two patients have participated in this study. They were asked to use the app for 4 weeks at home, 5 times a week, for 10 to 15 minutes. The intervention was designed in a randomised controlled pre-test/post-test design and patients were measured for neuromuscular parameters before the intervention and afterwards. Evaluated parameters included maximum voluntary contraction force, muscle separation, proportional control and muscle endurance, as well as user statistics.\nResults: After training with the app, a significant improvement (p < .01) in all examined clinical parameters for myoelectric control of a prosthesis could be achieved. The user statistics showed a high motivation to play the game and ran an additional diagnostic EMG-Test on one patient; the other participating patient, however, had played the game but neglected the EMG test and only completed half of it.\nConclusion: The training app not only provides instruction and feedback on the correct execution of myoelectric commands, but also maintains patient motivation through various game modes and feedback elements. The rehabilitation process could be monitored and compared through an overview of training progress in the form of user statistics and high scores. It could be shown that patients with upper extremity amputation could significantly improve their neuromuscular control, strength and coordination after using the game-based app so that they can fully benefit from the potential of a myoelectric prosthesis."

Implanted devices that record and transmit electromyographic (EMG) signals have been applied for the control of active prostheses. This simulation study investigates the propagation losses and the absorption rate of a wireless radio frequency link for in-to-on body communication in the medical implant communication service (MICS) frequency band to control myoelectric upper limb prostheses. The implanted antenna is selected and a suitable external antenna is designed. The characterization of both antennas is done by numerical simulations. A heterogeneous 3D body model and a 3D electromagnetic solver have been used to model the path loss and to characterize the specific absorption rate (SAR). The path loss parameters were extracted and the SAR was characterized, verifying the compliance with the guideline limits. The path loss model has been also used for a preliminary link budget analysis to determine the feasibility of such system compliant with the IEEE 802.15.6 standard. The resulting link margin of 11 dB confirms the feasibility of the system proposed."

Residual nerves from the amputated limb are transferred to reinnervate new muscle targets that have otherwise lost their function. These reinnervated muscles then serve as biological amplifiers of the amputated nerve motor signals, allowing for more intuitive control of advanced prosthetic arms. Here the authors provide a review of surgical techniques for TMR in patients with either transhumeral or shoulder disarticulation amputations. They also discuss how TMR may act synergistically with recent advances in prosthetic arm technologies to improve prosthesis controllability. Discussion of TMR and prosthesis control is presented in the context of a 41-year-old man with a left-side shoulder disarticulation and a right-side transhumeral amputation. This patient underwent bilateral TMR surgery and was fit with advanced pattern-recognition myoelectric prostheses."

    "abstract": "Although three million people around the world suffer from the lack of one or both upper limbs 80% of this number is located within developing countries. While prosthetic prices soar with technology 3D printing and low cost electronics present a sensible solution for those that cannot afford expensive prosthetics. The electronic and control design of a low-cost prosthetic hand, the Touch Hand II, is discussed. This paper shows that sensorless techniques can be used to reduce design complexities, costs, and provide easier access to the electronics. A closing and opening finite state machine (COFSM) was developed to handle the actuated digit joint control state and a supervisory switching control scheme, used for speed and grip strength control. Three torque and speed settings were created to be preset for specific grasps. The hand was able to replicate ten frequently used grasps and grip some common objects. Future work is necessary to enable a user to control it with myoelectric signals (MESs) and to solve operational problems related to electromagnetic interference (EMI)."

    "title": "Examination of force discrimination in human upper limb amputees with reinnervated limb sensation following peripheral nerve transfer",
    "abstract": "Artificial limbs allow amputees to manipulate objects, but the loss of a limb severs the sensory link between a subject and objects they touch. A novel surgical technique we term targeted reinnervation (TR) allows severed cutaneous nerves to reinnervate skin on a different portion of the body. This technique provides a physiologically appropriate portal to the sensory pathways of the missing limb through the reinnervated skin. This study quantified the ability of three amputee subjects who had undergone TR surgery on the chest (two subjects) and upper arm (one subject) to discriminate changes in graded force on their reinnervated skin over a range of 1-4 N using a stochastic staircase approach. These values were compared to those from sites on their intact contralateral skin and index fingers, and from the chests and index fingers of a control population (n = 10) . Weber's ratio (WR) was used to examine the subjects' abilities to discriminate between a baseline force and subsequent forces of different magnitudes. WRs of 0.22, 0.25, and 0.12 were measured on the reinnervated skin of the three TR subjects, whereas WRs of 0.25, 0.23, and 0.12 were measured on their contralateral skin. TR subjects did not have substantially different WRs on their reinnervated versus their contralateral normal side and did not appear to exhibit a trend towards impaired sensation. No significant difference was found between the WR of the chest and index finger of the control subjects, which ranged between 0.09 and 0.21. WR of reinnervated skin for TR subjects were within the 95% confidence interval of the control group. These data suggest that subjects with targeted reinnervation have unimpaired ability to discriminate gradations in force."

    "abstract": "Robot-assisted rehabilitation facilitates high-intensity training of the impaired upper limb in neurological rehabilitation. It has been clinically observed that persons with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) have difficulties in sustaining the training intensity during a session due to the development of activity-related muscle fatigue. An experimental observational pilot study was conducted to examine whether or not the muscle fatigue develops in MS patients during one session of robot-assisted training within a virtual learning environment. Six MS patients with upper limb impairment (motricity index ranging from 50 to 91/100) and six healthy persons completed five training bouts of three minutes each performing lifting tasks, while EMG signals of anterior deltoid and lower trapezius muscles were measured and their subjective perceptions on muscle fatigue were registered. Decreased performance and higher subjective fatigue perception were present in the MS group. Increased mean EMG amplitudes and subjective perception levels on muscle fatigue were observed in both groups. Muscle fatigue development during 15' training has been demonstrated in the arm of MS patients, which influences the sustainability of training intensity in MS patients. To optimize the training performance, adaptivity based on the detection of MS patient's muscle fatigue could be provided by means of training program adjustment."

    "abstract": "Electrocutaneous stimulation is a promising approach to provide sensory feedback to amputees, and thus close the loop in upper limb prosthetic systems. However, the stimulation introduces artifacts in the recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals, which may be detrimental for the control of myoelectric prostheses. In this study, artifact blanking with three data segmentation approaches was investigated as a simple method to restore the performance of pattern recognition in prosthesis control (eight motions) when EMG signals are corrupted by stimulation artifacts. The methods were tested over a range of stimulation conditions and using four feature sets, comprising both time and frequency domain features. The results demonstrated that when stimulation artifacts were present, the classification performance improved with blanking in all tested conditions. In some cases, the classification performance with blanking was at the level of the benchmark (artifact-free data). The greatest pulse duration and frequency that allowed a full performance recovery were 400 μs and 150 Hz, respectively. These results show that artifact blanking can be used as a practical solution to eliminate the negative influence of the stimulation artifact on EMG pattern classification in a broad range of conditions, thus allowing to close the loop in myoelectric prostheses using electrotactile feedback."

Robotic-assisted laparoscopy is expected to be less demanding compared to conventional laparoscopy; however, studies indicate that robotic-assisted laparoscopy is also associated with poor ergonomics and musculoskeletal pain.

Our study quantified and compared the muscular load during robotic-assisted laparoscopy using one of two custom built ergonomic chairs and a regular office chair. The results demonstrated no differences that could be considered clinically relevant. Overall, the study showed high levels of static and mean muscular activity, increased perceived physical exertion from pre-to-post surgery, and moderate to high risk for musculoskeletal injuries measured by the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment worksheet.

    "abstract": "This paper evaluates the prospects of using a novel Integrated Haptic Feedback (IHF) system. IHF can provide over-ground gait training regimens for post-stroke ambulatory subjects. IHF system combines the use of a portable cane for kinesthetic feedback and a wearable vibrotactor array for tactile feedback. Continuous somatosensory input is aiforded to the users at the handle of cane; it serves the purpose of balance assurance at higher gait speeds. Besides, restricted use of upper limb for weight-bearing inspires the users to involve the paretic lower limbs more actively. Furthermore, tactile feedback contributes in enhancing the gait symmetry through afferent signal of vibration. Six post-stroke ambulatory individuals participated in walking trials to identity the effects of IHF system. Results indicate that while walking faster patients' body sway was not disturbed. Statistically significant increase was observed in temporal stance symmetry (p-value=0.02) and in paretic muscle (vastus medialis obliquus and semitendinosus) activation during stance phase (p-value<0.01). The IHF system can be a valuable tool to assist physical therapist in gait rehabilitation of post-stroke individuals."

    "title": "Referral of sensation to an advanced humanoid robotic hand prosthesis",
    "abstract": "Hand prostheses that are currently available on the market are used by amputees to only a limited extent, partly because of lack of sensory feedback from the artificial hand. We report a pilot study that showed how amputees can experience a robot-like advanced hand prosthesis as part of their own body. We induced a perceptual illusion by which touch applied to the stump of the arm was experienced from the artificial hand. This illusion was elicited by applying synchronous tactile stimulation to the hidden amputation stump and the robotic hand prosthesis in full view. In five people who had had upper limb amputations this stimulation caused referral touch sensation from the stump to the artificial hand, and the prosthesis was experienced more like a real hand. We also showed that this illusion can work when the amputee controls the movements of the artificial hand by recordings of the arm muscle activity with electromyograms. These observations indicate that the previously described \"rubber hand illusion\" is also valid for an advanced hand prosthesis, even when it has a robotic-like appearance."

HD-sEMG signals were preprocessed and then decomposed into source signals corresponding to biceps brachhi (BB) and brachialis (BR) and their contribution vectors using a fast, independent component analysis (FastICA) algorithm. The activation heterogeneity of BB and BR was investigated from the activation level and activation region, initially. Then, the contribution combinations of two sources were classified into several major clusters using the K-means clustering method. Afterwards, input signals for force estimation were extracted from the major clusters corresponding to different combinations, and the polynomial fitting technique was adopted as the force estimation model. Finally, the force estimation results were obtained and the analysis around the force estimation performance using different input signals was conducted.\nMain results: Ten subjects were recruited in this research. The experimental results demonstrated that it is feasible to analyze the activation heterogeneity of muscles from the activation level and activation region, and to select the appropriate region of the HD-sEMG grid for high performance force estimation. For the isometric elbow flexion task, joint force estimation accuracy could be improved when the input signal was extracted from the specific area where the contribution difference of BB and BR to the HD-sEMG signals were relatively small.\nSignificance: The proposed framework provided a novel way to explore the relationship between muscle activation and the generating joint force, and could be extended to multiple noteworthy research fields such as myoelectric prostheses, sports biomechanics, and muscle disease diagnosis."

A detailed technical evaluation demonstrated the capabilities to render different haptic environments required for a comprehensive assessment battery, and showed that the device is suitable for human interaction due to its ergonomic design.

Providing adequate user control for these devices is a challenge but is crucial for successful performance. Electromyographic (EMG) signals can serve as effective control sources, but the number of above-injury muscles suitable to provide EMG-based control signals is very limited. Previous work has shown the presence of below-injury volitional myoelectric signals even in subjects diagnosed with motor complete spinal cord injury. In this case report, we present a demonstration of a hand grasp neuroprosthesis being controlled by a user with a C6 level, motor complete injury through EMG signals from their toe flexor. These signals were successfully translated into a functional grasp output, which performed similarly to the participant's usual shoulder position control in a grasp-release functional test. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the potential for below-injury myoelectric activity to serve as a novel form of neuroprosthesis control."

Since there is little object deformation when rigid objects are grasped, it is difficult for amputees to visually gauge the applied grip force in this situation.\nObjectives: To determine if the applied grip force from a prosthetic hand can be visually displayed and used to more efficaciously grasp objects.\nStudy design: Experimental controlled trial.\nMethods: Force feedback is used in the control algorithm for the prosthetic hand and supplied visually to the user through a bicolor LED experimentally mounted to the thumb. Several experiments are performed by able-bodied test subjects to rate the usefulness of the additional visual feedback when manipulating a clearly visible, brittle object that can break if grasped too firmly. A hybrid force-velocity sliding mode controller is used with and without additional visual force feedback supplied to the operators.\nResults: Subjective evaluations and success rates from the test subjects indicate a statistically significant reduction in breaking the grasped object when using the prosthesis with the extra visual feedback.\nConclusions: The additional visual force feedback can effectively facilitate the manipulation of brittle objects. Clinical relevance The novel approach of this research is the implementation of a noninvasive, effective and economic technique to visually indicate the grip force applied by a prosthetic hand to upper limb amputees. This technique provides a statistically significant improvement when handling brittle objects."

    "title": "Construction of efficacious gait and upper limb functional interventions based on brain plasticity evidence and model-based measures for stroke patients",
    "abstract": "For neurorehabilitation to advance from art to science, it must become evidence-based. Historically, there has been a dearth of evidence from which to construct rehabilitation interventions that are properly framed, accurately targeted, and credibly measured. In many instances, evidence of treatment response has not been sufficiently robust to demonstrate a change in function that is clinically, statistically, and economically important. Research evidence of activity-dependent central nervous system (CNS) plasticity and the requisite motor learning principles can be used to construct an efficacious motor recovery intervention. Brain plasticity after stroke refers to the regeneration of brain neuronal structures and/or reorganization of the function of neurons. Not only can CNS structure and function change in response to injury, but also, the changes may be modified by \"activity\". For gait training or upper limb functional training for stroke survivors, the \"activity\" is motor behavior, including coordination and strengthening exercise and functional training that comprise motor learning. Critical principles of motor learning required for CNS activity-dependent plasticity include: close-to-normal movements, muscle activation driving practice of movement; focused attention, repetition of desired movements, and training specificity. The ultimate goal of rehabilitation is to restore function so that a satisfying quality of life can be experienced. Accurate measurement of dysfunction and its underlying impairments are critical to the development of accurately targeted interventions that are sufficiently robust to produce gains, not only in function, but also in quality of life. The Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health Model (ICF) model of disablement, put forth by the World Health Organization, can provide not only some guidance in measurement level selection, but also can serve as a guide to incorporate function and quality of life enhancement as the ultimate goals of rehabilitation interventions. Based on the evidence and principles of activity-dependent plasticity and motor learning, we developed gait training and upper limb functional training protocols. Guided by the ICF model, we selected and developed measures with characteristics rendering them most likely to capture change in the targeted aspects of intervention, as well as measures having membership not only in the impairment, but also in the functional or life role participation levels contained in the ICF model. We measured response to innovative gait training using a knee flexion coordination measure, coefficient of coordination consistency (ACC) of relative hip/knee (H/K) movement across multiple steps (H/K ACC), and milestones of participation in life role activities. We measured response to upper limb functional training according to measures designed to quantify functional gains in response to treatment targeted at wrist/hand or shoulder elbow training (Arm Motor Ability Test for wrist/hand (AMAT W/H) or shoulder/elbow (AMAT S/E)). We found that there was a statistically significant advantage for adding FES-IM gait training to an otherwise comparable and comprehensive gait training, according to the following measures: H/K ACC, the measure of consistently executed hip/knee coordination during walking; a specific measure of isolated joint knee flexion coordination; and a measure of multiple coordinated gait components. Further, enhanced gains in gait component coordination were robust enough to result in achievement of milestones in participation in life role activities. In the upper limb functional training study, we found that robotics + motor learning (ROB ML; shoulder/elbow robotics practice plus motor learning) produced a statistically significant gain in AMAT S/E; whereas functional electrical stimulation + motor learning (FES ML) did not. We found that FES ML (wrist/hand FES plus motor learning) produced a statistically significant gain in AMAT W/H; whereas ROB ML did not. These results together, support the phenomenon of training specificity in that the most practiced joint movements improved in comparison to joint movements that were practiced at a lesser intensity and frequency. Both ROB ML and FES ML protocols addressed an array of impairments thought to underlie dysfunction. If we are willing to adhere to the ICF model, we accept the challenge that the goal of rehabilitation is life role participation, with functional improvement as in important intermediary step. The ICF model suggests that we intervene at multiple lower levels (e.g., pathology and impairment) in order to improve the higher levels of function and life role participation. The ICF model also suggests that we measure at each level. Not only can we then understand response to treatment at each level, but also, we can begin to understand relationships between levels (e.g., impairment and function). With the ICF model proffering the challenge of restoring life role participation, it then becomes important to design and test interventions that result in impairment gains sufficiently robust to be reflected in functional activities and further, in life role participation. Fortunately, CNS plasticity and associated motor learning principles can serve well as the basis for generating such interventions. These principles were useful in generating both efficacious gait training and efficacious upper limb functional training interventions. These principles led to the use of therapeutic agents (FES and robotics) so that close-to-normal movements could be practiced. These principles supported the use of specific therapeutic agents (BWSTT, FES, and robotics) so that sufficient movement repetition could be provided. These principles also supported incorporation of functional task practice and the demand of attention to task practice within the intervention. The ICF model provided the challenge to restore function and life role participation. The means to that end was provided by principles of CNS plasticity and motor learning."

    "title": "The artificial substitution of missing hands with myoelectrical prostheses",
    "abstract": "The fitting of upper-extremity amputees requires special efforts, and its significance has been increased by the development of myoelectrically controlled prosthetic arm. Although an artificial hand only represents a relatively modest substitute for the missing hand of human beings, the efforts of designers and the achievements of manufacturers should not go unnoticed. Because of the development of myoelectrically controlled prosthetic arm, the amputee's standard of function can be improved and a cosmetic and functional solution provided. For control of the electromechanical hand, muscular potentials are received from the residual limb surface, amplified in the electrodes, and transmitted as control signals to the distal area. An important factor in providing a successful fitting is a reliable man-machine connection. This article summarizes the historic development and state of the art of the myoelectrically controlled arm prosthesis. The components and technical evaluations of the Myobock system as well as the procedures for fitting and fabricating a below-elbow prosthesis have been improved recently. A critical analysis of adaptive hands suggests that the prospects for the future are good."

    "abstract": "Stroke can lead to sensory deficits that impair functional control of arm movements. Here we describe a simple test of arm motion detection (AMD) that provides an objective, quantitative measure of movement perception related proprioceptive capabilities in the arm. Seven stroke survivors and thirteen neurologically intact control subjects performed the AMD test. In a series of ten trials that took less than 15 minutes to complete, participants used a two-button user interface to adjust the magnitude of hand displacements produced by a horizontal planar robot until the motions were just perceptible (i.e. on the threshold of detection). The standard deviation of movement detection threshold was plotted against the mean and a normative range was determined from the data collected with control subjects. Within this normative space, subjects with and without intact proprioception could be discriminated on a ratio scale that is meaningful for ongoing studies of degraded motor function. Thus, the AMD test provides a relatively fast, objective and quantitative measure of upper extremity proprioception of limb movement (i.e. kinesthesia)."

    "title": "A cosmetic prosthetic digit with bioinspired embedded touch feedback",
    "abstract": "Partial hand amputation is the most frequent amputation level worldwide, accounting for approximately 90% of all upper limb amputations. Passive cosmetic prostheses represent one of the possible choices for its treatment, probably the most affordable one. However, these devices restore very limited motor function and subtle sensory feedback. The latter is an important component for restoring the body schema. In this work we present a simple yet potentially effective and low cost cosmetic digital prosthesis that embeds touch feedback; we dubbed this DESC-finger. It delivers short-lasting vibrotactile bursts when it makes and breaks contact with the environment, based on the Discrete Event-driven Sensory feedback Control (DESC) policy. One prototype was developed and used by one amputee at home, for two months. The effectiveness of the device was experimentally assessed by means of an interview and a virtual eggs test, which showed, albeit preliminarily, that time discrete feedback can improve the motor control of a partial hand prosthesis in daily life conditions. Besides targeting people that already use cosmetic digits, the DESC-finger targets those that do not use them complaining for loss of sensibility. The production costs and manufacturing process makes the DESC-finger suitable for exploitation in high- and low-income countries."

    "abstract": "The ability to detect physiological changes associated with treatments to effect axonal regeneration, or novel rehabilitation strategies, for spinal cord injury will be challenging using the widely employed American Spinal Injuries Association (ASIA) impairment scales (AIS) for sensory and motor function. Despite many revisions to the AIS standard neurological assessment, there remains a perceived need for more sensitive, quantitative and objective outcome measures. The purpose of Stage 1 of the Clinical Initiative was to develop these tools and then, in Stage 2 to test them for reliability against natural recovery and treatments expected to produce functional improvements in those with complete or incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Here we review aspects of the progress made by four teams involved in Stage 2. The strategies employed by the individual teams were (1) application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the motor cortex in stable (chronic) SCI with intent to induce functional improvement of upper limb function, (2) a tele-rehabilitation approach using functional electrical stimulation to provide hand opening and grip allowing incomplete SCI subjects to deploy an instrumented manipulandum for hand and arm exercises and to play computer games, (3) weight-assisted treadmill walking therapy (WAT) comparing outcomes in acute and chronic groups of incomplete SCI patients receiving robotic assisted treadmill therapy, and (4) longitudinal monitoring of the natural progress of recovery in incomplete SCI subjects using motor tests for the lower extremity to investigate strength and coordination."

    "title": "Sensory synergy as environmental input integration",
    "abstract": "The development of a method to feed proper environmental inputs back to the central nervous system (CNS) remains one of the challenges in achieving natural movement when part of the body is replaced with an artificial device. Muscle synergies are widely accepted as a biologically plausible interpretation of the neural dynamics between the CNS and the muscular system. Yet the sensorineural dynamics of environmental feedback to the CNS has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we address this issue by exploring the concept of sensory synergy. In contrast to muscle synergy, we hypothesize that sensory synergy plays an essential role in integrating the overall environmental inputs to provide low-dimensional information to the CNS. We assume that sensor synergy and muscle synergy communicate using these low-dimensional signals. To examine our hypothesis, we conducted posture control experiments involving lateral disturbance with nine healthy participants. Proprioceptive information represented by the changes on muscle lengths were estimated by using the musculoskeletal model analysis software SIMM. Changes on muscles lengths were then used to compute sensory synergies. The experimental results indicate that the environmental inputs were translated into the two dimensional signals and used to move the upper limb to the desired position immediately after the lateral disturbance. Participants who showed high skill in posture control were found to be likely to have a strong correlation between sensory and muscle signaling as well as high coordination between the utilized sensory synergies. These results suggest the importance of integrating environmental inputs into suitable low-dimensional signals before providing them to the CNS. This mechanism should be essential when designing the prosthesis' sensory system to make the controller simpler."

    "title": "Sensory Disturbances, but Not Motor Disturbances, Induced by Sensorimotor Conflicts Are Increased in the Presence of Acute Pain",
    "abstract": "Incongruence between our motor intention and the sensory feedback of the action (sensorimotor conflict) induces abnormalities in sensory perception in various chronic pain populations, and to a lesser extent in pain-free individuals. The aim of this study was to simultaneously investigate sensory and motor disturbances evoked by sensorimotor conflicts, as well as to assess how they are influenced by the presence of acute pain. It was hypothesized that both sensory and motor disturbances would be increased in presence of pain, which would suggest that pain makes body representations less robust. Thirty healthy participants realized cyclic asymmetric movements of flexion-extension with both upper limbs in a robotized system combined to a 2D virtual environment. The virtual environment provided a visual feedback (VF) about movements that was either congruent or incongruent, while the robotized system precisely measured motor performance (characterized by bilateral amplitude asymmetry and medio-lateral drift). Changes in sensory perception were assessed with a questionnaire after each trial. The effect of pain (induced with capsaicin) was compared to three control conditions (no somatosensory stimulation, tactile distraction and proprioceptive masking). Results showed that while both sensory and motor disturbances were induced by sensorimotor conflicts, only sensory disturbances were enhanced during pain condition comparatively to the three control conditions. This increase did not statistically differ across VF conditions (congruent or incongruent). Interestingly however, the types of sensations evoked by the conflict in the presence of pain (changes in intensity of pain or discomfort, changes in temperature or impression of a missing limb) were different than those evoked by the conflict alone (loss of control, peculiarity and the perception of having an extra limb). Finally, results showed no relationship between the amount of motor and sensory disturbances evoked in a given individual. Contrary to what was hypothesized, acute pain does not appear to make people more sensitive to the conflict itself, but rather impacts on the type and amount of sensory disturbances that they experienced in response to that conflict. Moreover, the results suggest that some sensorimotor integration processes remain intact in presence of acute pain, allowing us to maintain adaptive motor behavior."

    "abstract": "The combined use of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and robotic technologies is advocated to improve rehabilitation outcomes after stroke. This work describes an arm rehabilitation system developed within the European project RETRAINER. The system consists of a passive 4-degrees-of-freedom exoskeleton equipped with springs to provide gravity compensation and electromagnetic brakes to hold target positions. FES is integrated in the system to provide additional support to the most impaired muscles. FES is triggered based on the volitional EMG signal of the same stimulated muscle; in order to encourage the active involvement of the patient the volitional EMG is also monitored throughout the task execution and based on it a happy or sad emoji is visualized at the end of each task. The control interface control of the system provides a GUI and multiple software tools to organize rehabilitation exercises and monitor rehabilitation progress. The functionality and the usability of the system was evaluated on four stroke patients. All patients were able to use the system and judged positively its wearability and the provided support. They were able to trigger the stimulation based on their residual muscle activity and provided different levels of active involvement in the exercise, in agreement with their level of impairment. A randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the RETRAINER system to improve arm function after stroke is currently ongoing."

    "abstract": "Currently, most of the adopted myoelectric schemes for upper limb prostheses do not provide users with intuitive control. Higher accuracies have been reported using different classification algorithms but investigation on the reliability over time for these methods is very limited. In this study, we compared for the first time the longitudinal performance of selected state-of-the-art techniques for electromyography (EMG) based classification of hand motions. Experiments were conducted on ten able-bodied and six transradial amputees for seven continuous days. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision trees (TREE) were compared. Comparative analysis showed that the ANN attained highest classification accuracy followed by LDA. Three-way repeated ANOVA test showed a significant difference (P < 0.001) between EMG types (surface, intramuscular, and combined), days (1-7), classifiers, and their interactions. Performance on the last day was significantly better (P < 0.05) than the first day for all classifiers and EMG types. Within-day, classification error (WCE) across all subject and days in ANN was: surface (9.12 ± 7.38%), intramuscular (11.86 ± 7.84%), and combined (6.11 ± 7.46%). The between-day analysis in a leave-one-day-out fashion showed that the ANN was the optimal classifier (surface (21.88 ± 4.14%), intramuscular (29.33 ± 2.58%), and combined (14.37 ± 3.10%). Results indicate that within day performances of classifiers may be similar but over time, it may lead to a substantially different outcome. Furthermore, training ANN on multiple days might allow capturing time-dependent variability in the EMG signals and thus minimizing the necessity for daily system recalibration."

    "title": "A hybrid brain-machine interface based on EEG and EMG activity for the motor rehabilitation of stroke patients",
    "abstract": "Including supplementary information from the brain or other body parts in the control of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has been recently proposed and investigated. Such enriched interfaces are referred to as hybrid BMIs (hBMIs) and have been proven to be more robust and accurate than regular BMIs for assistive and rehabilitative applications. Electromyographic (EMG) activity is one of the most widely utilized biosignals in hBMIs, as it provides a quite direct measurement of the motion intention of the user. Whereas most of the existing non-invasive EEG-EMG-hBMIs have only been subjected to offline testings or are limited to one degree of freedom (DoF), we present an EEG-EMG-hBMI that allows the simultaneous control of 7-DoFs of the upper limb with a robotic exoskeleton. Moreover, it establishes a biologically-inspired hierarchical control flow, requiring the active participation of central and peripheral structures of the nervous system. Contingent visual and proprioceptive feedback about the user's EEG and EMG activity is provided in the form of velocity modulation during functional task training. We believe that training with this closed-loop system may facilitate functional neuroplastic processes and eventually elicit a joint brain and muscle motor rehabilitation. Its usability is validated during a real-time operation session in a healthy participant and a chronic stroke patient, showing encouraging results for its application to a clinical rehabilitation scenario."

    "abstract": "The lack of proprioceptive feedback is a serious deficiency of current prosthetic control systems. The Osseo-Magnetic Link (OML) is a novel humeral or wrist rotation control system that could preserve proprioception. It utilizes a magnet implanted within the residual bone and sensors mounted in the prosthetic socket to detect magnetic field vectors and determine the bone's orientation. This allows the use of volitional bone rotation to control a prosthetic rotator. We evaluated the performance of the OML using a physical model of a transhumeral residual limb. A small Neodymium-Iron-Boron magnet was placed in a model humerus, inside a model upper arm. Four three-axis Hall-effect sensors were mounted on a ring 3 cm distal to the magnet. An optimization algorithm based on Newton's method determined the position and orientation of the magnet within the model humerus under various conditions, including bone translations, interference, and magnet misalignment. The orientation of the model humerus was determined within 3° for rotations centered in the arm; an additional 6° error was found for translations 20 mm from center. Adjustments in sensor placement may reduce these errors. The results demonstrate that the OML is a feasible solution for providing prosthesis rotation control while preserving rotational proprioception."

    "title": "Closed-loop control of spinal cord stimulation to restore hand function after paralysis",
    "abstract": "As yet, no cure exists for upper-limb paralysis resulting from the damage to motor pathways after spinal cord injury or stroke. Recently, neural activity from the motor cortex of paralyzed individuals has been used to control the movements of a robot arm but restoring function to patients' actual limbs remains a considerable challenge. Previously we have shown that electrical stimulation of the cervical spinal cord in anesthetized monkeys can elicit functional upper-limb movements like reaching and grasping. Here we show that stimulation can be controlled using cortical activity in awake animals to bypass disruption of the corticospinal system, restoring their ability to perform a simple upper-limb task. Monkeys were trained to grasp and pull a spring-loaded handle. After temporary paralysis of the hand was induced by reversible inactivation of primary motor cortex using muscimol, grasp-related single-unit activity from the ventral premotor cortex was converted into stimulation patterns delivered in real-time to the cervical spinal gray matter. During periods of closed-loop stimulation, task-modulated electromyogram, movement amplitude, and task success rate were improved relative to interleaved control periods without stimulation. In some sessions, single motor unit activity from weakly active muscles was also used successfully to control stimulation. These results are the first use of a neural prosthesis to improve the hand function of primates after motor cortex disruption, and demonstrate the potential for closed-loop cortical control of spinal cord stimulation to reanimate paralyzed limbs."

    "abstract": "According to the neuro-rehabilitation theory, compared with unilateral training, bilateral training is proven to be an effective method for hemiparesis, which affects the most part of stroke patients. In this study, a novel bilateral rehabilitation training system, which incorporates a lightweight exoskeleton device worn on the affected limb; a haptic device (Phantom Premium), which is used for generating a desired tactile feedback for the affected limb; and a VR (virtual reality) graphic interface, has been developed. The use of VR technology during rehabilitation can provide goal directed tasks with rewards and motivate the patient to undertake extended rehabilitation. This paper is mainly focused on elbow joint training, and other independent joints can be trained by easily changing the VR training interface. The haptic device is adopted to enable patients to use their own decision making abilities with a tactical feedback. Integrated with a VR-based graphic interface, the goal-oriented task can help to gradually recovery their motor function with a coordinative motion between two limbs. In particular, the proposed system can accelerate neural plasticity and motor recovery in those patients with little muscle strength by using the exoskeleton device. The exoskeleton device can provide from relatively high joint impedance to near-zero impedance, and can provide a partial assist as the patient requires."

    "title": "FES-induced co-activation of antagonist muscles for upper limb control and disturbance rejection",

Nevertheless, there is still a limited number of such applications available today on worldwide markets, indicating poor performance in real settings, particularly for upper limb rehabilitation and assistance. Based on these premises, in this paper we explore the use of an alternative control strategy based on co-activation of antagonist muscles using FES. Although co-contraction may accelerate fatigue when compared to single-muscle activation, knowledge from motor control indicate it may be useful for some applications. We have performed a simulation and experimental study designed to evaluate whether controllers that integrate such features can modulate joint impedance and, by doing so, improving performance with respect to disturbance rejection. The simulation results, obtained using a novel model including proprioceptive feedback and anatomical data, indicate that both stiffness and damping components of joint impedance may be modulated by using FES-induced co-activation of antagonist muscles. Preliminary experimental trials were conducted on four healthy subjects using surface electrodes. While the simulation investigation predicted a maximum 494% increase in joint stiffness for wrist flexion/extension, experiments provided an average elbow stiffness increase of 138% using lower stimulation intensity. Closed-loop experiments in which disturbances were applied have demonstrated that improved behavior may be obtained, but increased joint stiffness and other issues related to simultaneous stimulation of antagonist muscles may indeed produce greater errors."

Participants. Forty-four patients affected by stroke. Intervention. The patients were randomized into two groups: RFVE (N = 23) and TR (N = 21), and stratified according to stroke etiology. The RFVE treatment consisted of multidirectional exercises providing augmented feedback provided by virtual reality, while in the TR treatment the same exercises were provided without augmented feedbacks. Outcome Measures. Fugl-Meyer upper extremity scale (F-M UE), Functional Independence Measure scale (FIM), and kinematics parameters (speed, time, and peak).\nResults: The F-M UE (P = 0.030), FIM (P = 0.021), time (P = 0.008), and peak (P = 0.018), were significantly higher in the RFVE group after treatment, but not speed (P = 0.140). The patients affected by hemorrhagic stroke significantly improved FIM (P = 0.031), time (P = 0.011), and peak (P = 0.020) after treatment, whereas the patients affected by ischemic stroke improved significantly only speed (P = 0.005) when treated by RFVE.\nConclusion: These results indicated that some poststroke patients may benefit from RFVE program for the recovery of upper limb motor function.

    "abstract": "Surface electromyogram-controlled powered hand/wrist prostheses return partial upper-limb function to limb-absent persons. Typically, one degree of freedom (DoF) is controlled at a time, with mode switching between DoFs. Recent research has explored using large-channel EMG systems to provide simultaneous, independent and proportional (SIP) control of two joints-but such systems are not practical in current commercial prostheses. Thus, we investigated site selection of a minimum number of conventional EMG electrodes in an EMG-force task, targeting four sites for a two DoF controller. In a laboratory experiment with 10 able-bodied subjects and three limb-absent subjects, 16 electrodes were placed about the proximal forearm. Subjects produced 1-DoF and 2-DoF slowly force-varying contractions up to 30% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). EMG standard deviation was related to forces via regularized regression. Backward stepwise selection was used to retain those progressively fewer electrodes that exhibited minimum error. For 1-DoF models using two retained electrodes (which mimics the current state of the art), subjects had average RMS errors of (depending on the DoF): 7.1-9.5% MVC for able-bodied and 13.7-17.1% MVC for limb-absent subjects. For 2-DoF models, subjects using four electrodes had errors on 1-DoF trials of 6.7-8.5% MVC for able-bodied and 11.9-14.0% MVC for limb-absent; and errors on 2-DoF trials of 9.9-11.2% MVC for able-bodied and 15.8-16.7% MVC for limb-absent subjects. For each model, retaining more electrodes did not statistically improve performance. The able-bodied results suggest that backward selection is a viable method for minimum error selection of as few as four electrode sites for these EMG-force tasks. Performance evaluation in a prosthesis control task is a necessary and logical next step for this site selection method."

Many studies have reported pattern recognition classification error performances of less than 10% during offline tests; however, it remains unclear how this translates to real-time control performance. In this contribution, we compare the real-time control performances between pattern recognition and direct myoelectric control (a popular form of conventional amplitude control) for participants who had received targeted muscle reinnervation. The real-time performance was evaluated during three tasks; 1) a box and blocks task, 2) a clothespin relocation task, and 3) a block stacking task. Our results found that pattern recognition significantly outperformed direct control for all three performance tasks. Furthermore, it was found that pattern recognition was configured much quicker. The classification error of the pattern recognition systems used by the patients was found to be 16% ±(1.6%) suggesting that systems with this error rate may still provide excellent control. Finally, patients qualitatively preferred using pattern recognition control and reported the resulting control to be smoother and more consistent."

    "abstract": "Recent experiments have shown that neural stimulation can successfully restore sensory feedback in upper-limb amputees improving their ability to control the prosthesis. However, the potential advantages of invasive sensory feedback with respect to non-invasive solutions have not been yet identified. Our hypothesis was that a difference would appear when the subject cannot focus all the attention to the use of the prosthesis, but some additional activities require his/her cognitive attention, which is a quite common situation in real-life conditions. To verify this hypothesis, we asked a trans-radial amputee, equipped with a bidirectional hand prosthesis, to perform motor tasks also in combination with a cognitive task. Sensory feedback was provided via intraneural (invasive) or electro-tactile (non-invasive) stimulation. We collected also data related to self-confidence. While both approaches were able to significantly improve the motor performance of the subject when no additional cognitive effort was asked, the manual accuracy was not affected by the cognitive task only when intraneural feedback was provided. The highest self-confidence was obtained when intraneural sensory feedback was provided. Our findings show that intraneural sensory feedback is more robust to dual tasks than non-invasive feedback. This is the first direct comparison between invasive and non-invasive approaches for restoring sensory feedback and it could suggest an advantage of using invasive solutions.

    "title": "Towards Efficient Decoding of Multiple Classes of Motor Imagery Limb Movements Based on EEG Spectral and Time Domain Descriptors",
    "abstract": "To control multiple degrees of freedom (MDoF) upper limb prostheses, pattern recognition (PR) of electromyogram (EMG) signals has been successfully applied. This technique requires amputees to provide sufficient EMG signals to decode their limb movement intentions (LMIs). However, amputees with neuromuscular disorder/high level amputation often cannot provide sufficient EMG control signals, and thus the applicability of the EMG-PR technique is limited especially to this category of amputees. As an alternative approach, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals recorded non-invasively from the brain have been utilized to decode the LMIs of humans. However, most of the existing EEG based limb movement decoding methods primarily focus on identifying limited classes of upper limb movements. In addition, investigation on EEG feature extraction methods for the decoding of multiple classes of LMIs has rarely been considered. Therefore, 32 EEG feature extraction methods (including 12 spectral domain descriptors (SDDs) and 20 time domain descriptors (TDDs)) were used to decode multiple classes of motor imagery patterns associated with different upper limb movements based on 64-channel EEG recordings. From the obtained experimental results, the best individual TDD achieved an accuracy of 67.05 ± 3.12% as against 87.03 ± 2.26% for the best SDD. By applying a linear feature combination technique, an optimal set of combined TDDs recorded an average accuracy of 90.68% while that of the SDDs achieved an accuracy of 99.55% which were significantly higher than those of the individual TDD and SDD at p < 0.05. Our findings suggest that optimal feature set combination would yield a relatively high decoding accuracy that may improve the clinical robustness of MDoF neuroprosthesis.\nTrial registration: The study was approved by the ethics committee of Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, and the reference number is SIAT-IRB-150515-H0077."

The development of anthropomorphic robotic arms and of algorithms to decode intended movements from neuronal signals has stimulated the need to restore somatosensation for use in upper-limb neuroprostheses. Without touch and proprioception, patients have difficulty controlling prosthetic limbs to a level that justifies the required invasive surgery. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) through chronically implanted electrode arrays has the potential to provide rich and intuitive sensory feedback. This approach to sensory restoration requires, however, that the evoked sensations remain stable over time.\nApproach: To investigate the stability of ICMS-evoked sensations, we measured the ability of non-human primates to detect ICMS over experimental sessions that spanned years.\nMain results: We found that the performance of the animals remained highly stable over time, even when they were tested with electrodes that had experienced extensive stimulation.\nSignificance: Given the stability of the sensations that it evokes, ICMS may thus be a viable approach for sensory restoration."

The aim of this study was to develop a model for continuous and simultaneous decoding of multi-joint dynamic arm movements based on multi-channel surface EMG signals crossing the joints, leading to application of myoelectrically controlled exoskeleton robots for upper-limb rehabilitation. Twenty subjects were recruited for this study including 10 stroke subjects and 10 able-bodied subjects. The subjects performed free arm reaching movements in the horizontal plane with an exoskeleton robot. The shoulder, elbow and wrist movements and surface EMG signals from six muscles crossing the three joints were recorded. A non-linear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model was developed to continuously decode the shoulder, elbow and wrist movements based solely on the EMG signals. The shoulder, elbow and wrist movements were decoded accurately based only on the EMG inputs in all the subjects, with the variance accounted for (VAF) > 98% for all three joints. The proposed approach is capable of simultaneously and continuously decoding multi-joint movements of the human arm by taking into account the non-linear mappings between the muscle EMGs and joint movements, which may provide less effortful control of robotic exoskeletons for rehabilitation training of individuals with neurological disorders and arm impairment."

    "title": "Restoring motor control and sensory feedback in people with upper extremity amputations using arrays of 96 microelectrodes implanted in the median and ulnar nerves",
    "abstract": "Objective: An important goal of neuroprosthetic research is to establish bidirectional communication between the user and new prosthetic limbs that are capable of controlling >20 different movements. One strategy for achieving this goal is to interface the prosthetic limb directly with efferent and afferent fibres in the peripheral nervous system using an array of intrafascicular microelectrodes. This approach would provide access to a large number of independent neural pathways for controlling high degree-of-freedom prosthetic limbs, as well as evoking multiple-complex sensory percepts.\nApproach: Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (USEAs, 96 recording/stimulating electrodes) were implanted for 30 days into the median (Subject 1-M, 31 years post-amputation) or ulnar (Subject 2-U, 1.5 years post-amputation) nerves of two amputees. Neural activity was recorded during intended movements of the subject's phantom fingers and a linear Kalman filter was used to decode the neural data. Microelectrode stimulation of varying amplitudes and frequencies was delivered via single or multiple electrodes to investigate the number, size and quality of sensory percepts that could be evoked. Device performance over time was assessed by measuring: electrode impedances, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), stimulation thresholds, number and stability of evoked percepts.\nMain results: The subjects were able to proportionally, control individual fingers of a virtual robotic hand, with 13 different movements decoded offline (r = 0.48) and two movements decoded online. Electrical stimulation across one USEA evoked >80 sensory percepts. Varying the stimulation parameters modulated percept quality. Devices remained intrafascicularly implanted for the duration of the study with no significant changes in the SNRs or percept thresholds.\nSignificance: This study demonstrated that an array of 96 microelectrodes can be implanted into the human peripheral nervous system for up to 1 month durations. Such an array could provide intuitive control of a virtual prosthetic hand with broad sensory feedback."

    "abstract": "Background: After cervical spinal cord injury, current options for treatment of upper extremity motor functions have been limited to traditional approaches. However, there is a substantial need to explore more rigorous alternative treatments to facilitate motor recovery.\nObjective: To demonstrate whether anodal-primary motor cortex (M1) excitability enhancement (with cathodal-supra orbital area) (atDCS) combined with robot-assisted arm training (R-AAT) will provide greater improvement in contralateral arm and hand motor functions compared to sham stimulation (stDCS) and R-AAT in patients with chronic, incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (iCSCI).\nMethods: In this parallel-group, double-blinded, randomized and sham-controlled trial, nine participants with chronic iCSCI (AIS C and D level) were randomized to receive 10 sessions of atDCS or stDSC combined with R-AAT. Feasibility and tolerability was assessed with attrition rate and occurrence of adverse events, Changes in arm and hand function were assessed with Jebson Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT). Amount of Use Scale of Motor Activity Log (AOU-MAL), American Spinal Injury Association Upper Extremity Motor Score and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) at baseline, after treatment, and at two-month follow-up.\nResults: None of the participants missed a treatment session or dropped-out due to adverse events related to the treatment protocol. Participants tended to perform better in JTHFT and AOU-MAL after treatment. Active group at post-treatment and two-month follow-up demonstrated better arm and hand performance compared to sham group.\nConclusion: These preliminary findings support that modulating excitatory input of the corticospinal tracts on spinal circuits may be a promising strategy in improving arm and hand functions in persons with incomplete tetraplegia. Further study is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of recovery."

    "title": "Spatial asymmetry in tactile sensor skin deformation aids perception of edge orientation during haptic exploration",
    "abstract": "Upper-limb amputees rely primarily on visual feedback when using their prostheses to interact with others or objects in their environment. A constant reliance upon visual feedback can be mentally exhausting and does not suffice for many activities when line-of-sight is unavailable. Upper-limb amputees could greatly benefit from the ability to perceive edges, one of the most salient features of 3D shape, through touch alone. We present an approach for estimating edge orientation with respect to an artificial fingertip through haptic exploration using a multimodal tactile sensor on a robot hand. Key parameters from the tactile signals for each of four exploratory procedures were used as inputs to a support vector regression model. Edge orientation angles ranging from -90 to 90 degrees were estimated with an 85-input model having an R (2) of 0.99 and RMS error of 5.08 degrees. Electrode impedance signals provided the most useful inputs by encoding spatially asymmetric skin deformation across the entire fingertip. Interestingly, sensor regions that were not in direct contact with the stimulus provided particularly useful information. Methods described here could pave the way for semi-autonomous capabilities in prosthetic or robotic hands during haptic exploration, especially when visual feedback is unavailable."

It also assesses the efficacy in motor improvements on the stroke-affected upper limb using EEG-based MI-BCI with robotic feedback neurorehabilitation compared to robotic rehabilitation that delivers movement therapy. 54 hemiparetic stroke patients with mean age of 51.8 and baseline Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) 14.9 (out of 66, higher = better) were recruited. Results showed that 48 subjects (89%) operated EEG-based MI-BCI better than at chance level, and their ability to operate EEG-based MI-BCI is not correlated to their baseline FMA (r=0.358). Those subjects who gave consent are randomly assigned to each group (N=11 and 14) for 12 1-hour rehabilitation sessions for 4 weeks. Significant gains in FMA scores were observed in both groups at post-rehabilitation (4.5, 6.2; p=0.032, 0.003) and 2-month post-rehabilitation (5.3, 7.3; p=0.020, 0.013), but no significant differences were observed between groups (p=0.512, 0.550). Hence, this study showed evidences that a majority of hemiparetic stroke patients can operate EEG-based MI-BCI, and that EEG-based MI-BCI with robotic feedback neurorehabilitation is effective in restoring upper extremities motor function in stroke."

    "abstract": "Background: Impairment of position sense of the upper extremity (UE) may impede activities of daily living and limit motor gains after stroke. Most clinical assessments of position sense rely on categorical or ordinal ratings by clinicians that lack sensitivity to change or the ability to discriminate subtle deficits.\nObjective: Use robotic technology to develop a reliable, quantitative technique with a continuous scale to assess UE position sense following stroke.\nMethods: Forty-five patients recruited from an inpatient stroke rehabilitation service and 65 age-matched healthy controls performed an arm position matching task. Each UE was fitted in the exoskeleton of a KINARM device. One UE was passively placed in one of 9 positions, and the subject was told to match his or her position with the other UE. Patients were compared with statistical distributions of control data to identify those with deficits in UE position sense. Test-retest sessions using 2 raters established interrater reliability.\nResults: Two thirds of left hemiparetic and one third of right hemiparetic patients had deficits in limb position sense. Left-affected stroke subjects demonstrated significantly more trial-to-trial variability than right-affected or control subjects. The robotic assessment technique demonstrated good interrater reliability but limited agreement with the clinical thumb localizing test.\nConclusions: Robotic technology can provide a reliable quantitative means to assess deficits in limb position sense following stroke."

In this paper, a gesture recognition interface system developed specifically for individuals with upper-level spinal cord injuries (SCIs) was combined with object tracking and face recognition systems to be an efficient, hands-free WMRM controller. In this test system, two Kinect cameras were used synergistically to perform a variety of simple object retrieval tasks. One camera was used to interpret the hand gestures to send as commands to control the WMRM and locate the operator's face for object positioning. The other sensor was used to automatically recognize different daily living objects for test subjects to select. The gesture recognition interface incorporated hand detection, tracking and recognition algorithms to obtain a high recognition accuracy of 97.5% for an eight-gesture lexicon. An object recognition module employing Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm was performed and recognition results were sent as a command for \"coarse positioning\" of the robotic arm near the selected daily living object. Automatic face detection was also provided as a shortcut for the subjects to position the objects to the face by using a WMRM. Completion time tasks were conducted to compare manual (gestures only) and semi-manual (gestures, automatic face detection and object recognition) WMRM control modes. The use of automatic face and object detection significantly increased the completion times for retrieving a variety of daily living objects."

    "title": "A cervical propriospinal system in man",
    "abstract": "Peripheral stimuli facilitate, at a pre-motoneuronal level, the responses elicited in human upper limb motoneurons (MNs) by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex (TMS). Several features indicate that the relevant premotoneurones are distinct from segmental interneurones and located rostral to MNs. Thus, corticospinal volleys would have an indirect (propriospinal) pathway to upper limb MNs, in addition to the direct cortico-motoneuronal pathway. Slightly increasing the corticospinal input causes the facilitation to be reversed to inhibition. This is consistent with a well-developed system of inhibitory intemeurones activated by corticospinal and afferent inputs inhibiting propriospinal neurones (PNs). Corticospinal activation of these inhibitory interneurones would explain why propriospinally-mediated corticospinal EPSPs are weak in primate MNs after artificial (electrical or magnetic) activation of the corticospinal system by itself. However, indirect evidence for descending facilitation of PNs can be provided during normal voluntary contractions, while using the modulation of the ongoing EMG or of the H reflex."

This new device is dedicated to regular and efficient rehabilitation training for post-stroke and injured people without the continuous presence of a therapist. The exoskeleton is a wearable robotic device attached to the human arm. The user provides information signals to the controller by means of the force sensors around the wrist and the arm, and the robot controller generates the appropriate control signals for different training strategies and paradigms. This upper extremity exoskeleton covers four basic degrees of freedom of the shoulder and the elbow joints with three additional adaptability degrees of freedom in order to match the arm anatomy of different users. For comfortable and efficient rehabilitation, a new heuristic method have been studied and applied on our prototype in order to calculate the gravity compensation model without the need to identify the mass parameters. It is based on the geometric model of the robot and accurate torque measurements of the prototype's actuators in a set of specifically chosen joint positions. The weight effect has been successfully compensated so that the user can move his arm freely while wearing the exoskeleton without feeling its mass."

Lot of effort has been spent to design accurate algorithms for muscular torque estimation, while very few studies attempted to understand to what extent an accurate torque estimate is indeed necessary to provide effective movement assistance through powered exoskeletons. In this study, we focus on the latter aspect by using a simple and \"low-accuracy\" torque estimate, an EMG-proportional control, to provide assistance through an elbow exoskeleton. Preliminary results show that subjects adapt almost instantaneously to the assistance provided by the exoskeleton and can reduce their effort while keeping full control of the movement."

    "title": "Design and Optimization of an EEG-Based Brain Machine Interface (BMI) to an Upper-Limb Exoskeleton for Stroke Survivors",
    "abstract": "This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting motor intent from brain activity of chronic stroke patients using an asynchronous electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain machine interface (BMI). Intent was inferred from movement related cortical potentials (MRCPs) measured over an optimized set of EEG electrodes. Successful intent detection triggered the motion of an upper-limb exoskeleton (MAHI Exo-II), to guide movement and to encourage active user participation by providing instantaneous sensory feedback. Several BMI design features were optimized to increase system performance in the presence of single-trial variability of MRCPs in the injured brain: (1) an adaptive time window was used for extracting features during BMI calibration; (2) training data from two consecutive days were pooled for BMI calibration to increase robustness to handle the day-to-day variations typical of EEG, and (3) BMI predictions were gated by residual electromyography (EMG) activity from the impaired arm, to reduce the number of false positives. This patient-specific BMI calibration approach can accommodate a broad spectrum of stroke patients with diverse motor capabilities. Following BMI optimization on day 3, testing of the closed-loop BMI-MAHI exoskeleton, on 4th and 5th days of the study, showed consistent BMI performance with overall mean true positive rate (TPR) = 62.7 ± 21.4% on day 4 and 67.1 ± 14.6% on day 5. The overall false positive rate (FPR) across subjects was 27.74 ± 37.46% on day 4 and 27.5 ± 35.64% on day 5; however for two subjects who had residual motor function and could benefit from the EMG-gated BMI, the mean FPR was quite low (< 10%). On average, motor intent was detected -367 ± 328 ms before movement onset during closed-loop operation. These findings provide evidence that closed-loop EEG-based BMI for stroke patients can be designed and optimized to perform well across multiple days without system recalibration."

The questionnaire was available online and in paper format and was distributed through healthcare providers, community support groups, and one prosthesis manufacturer; 242 participants of all ages and levels of upper limb absence completed the survey.\nResults: Rates of rejection for myoelectric hands, passive hands, and body-powered hooks were 39%, 53%, and 50%, respectively. Prosthesis wearers were generally satisfied with their devices while prosthesis rejecters were dissatisfied. Reduced prosthesis weight emerged as the highest priority design concern of consumers. Lower cost ranked within the top five design priorities for adult wearers of all device types. Life-like appearance is a priority for passive/cosmetic prostheses, while improved harness comfort, wrist movement, grip control and strength are required for body-powered devices. Glove durability, lack of sensory feedback, and poor dexterity were also identified as design priorities for electric devices.\nConclusions: Design priorities reflect consumer goals for prosthesis use and vary depending on the type of prosthesis used and age. Future design efforts should focus on the development of more light-weight, comfortable prostheses."

It detects the stroke person's intention using his/her surface electromyography (EMG) signals from the hemiplegic side and assists in hand opening or hand closing functional tasks. The robotic system is made up of an embedded controller and a robotic hand module which can be adjusted to fit for different finger length. Eight chronic stroke subjects had been recruited to evaluate the effects of this device. The preliminary results showed significant improvement in hand functions (ARAT) and upper limb functions (FMA) after 20 sessions of robot-assisted hand functions task training. With the use of this light and portable robotic device, stroke patients can now practice more easily for the opening and closing of their hands at their own will, and handle functional daily living tasks at ease. A video is included together with this paper to give a demonstration of the hand robotic system on chronic stroke subjects and it will be presented in the conference."

    "abstract": "To study the effects of different feedback error amplification methods on a subject's upper-limb motor learning and affect during a point-to-point reaching exercise, we developed a real-time controller for a robotic manipulandum. The reaching environment was visually distorted by implementing a thirty degrees rotation between the coordinate systems of the robot's end-effector and the visual display. Feedback error amplification was provided to subjects as they trained to learn reaching within the visually rotated environment. Error amplification was provided either visually or through both haptic and visual means, each method with two different amplification gains. Subjects' performance (i.e., trajectory error) and self-reports to a questionnaire were used to study the speed and amount of adaptation promoted by each error amplification method and subjects' emotional changes. We found that providing haptic and visual feedback promotes faster adaptation to the distortion and increases subjects' satisfaction with the task, leading to a higher level of attentiveness during the exercise. This finding can be used to design a novel exercise regimen, where alternating between error amplification methods is used to both increase a subject's motor learning and maintain a minimum level of motivational engagement in the exercise. In future experiments, we will test whether such exercise methods will lead to a faster learning time and greater motivation to pursue a therapy exercise regimen."

    "abstract": "A reliable, flexible and simple source of information would benefit robust handling of predicting locomotion modes for assistive device control (e.g., prostheses). However, to date, the sources of mechanical signals have been mainly limited to the information acquired through embedded sensors in the device. It remains unclear whether biomechanical signals from unaffected or less affected locations (e.g., contralateral side or upper body) would be reliable sources of information. Furthermore, the possible influence of the anticipatory state of the task on recognition accuracy, emphasizes the need to identify reliable data sources for both anticipated and unanticipated tasks. Here, accelerographic and gyroscopic signals from the leading leg, trailing leg, trunk-pelvis, and their fusion were compared with respect to their ability to predict changes of direction (cuts), cut-to-stair transitions, and level-ground walking performed under varied task anticipation. We hypothesized that fusion of lower- and upper-body signals would provide better accuracy than unilateral information (i.e., trailing/leading leg), and recognition accuracy would diminish when tasks were unanticipated. Surprisingly, signal fusion appeared not to be advantageous to unilateral signals. Leading and trailing leg data demonstrated statistically identical performances, and trunk-pelvis signals showed significantly (α=0.05) inferior performance relative to unilateral data. While anticipated tasks were accurately predicted (≥90%) even as early as 500 ms prior to entering each locomotor transition, in unanticipated tasks, similar accuracy rates were achieved only after the mid-swing of the transitioning leg. The findings could provide insight into flexible, yet, dependable sensor sets for intent recognition frameworks during varying user cognitive states."

    "title": "New control strategies for neuroprosthetic systems",
    "abstract": "The availability of techniques to artificially excite paralyzed muscles opens enormous potential for restoring both upper and lower extremity movements with neuroprostheses. Neuroprostheses must stimulate muscle, and control and regulate the artificial movements produced. Control methods to accomplish these tasks include feedforward (open-loop), feedback, and adaptive control. Feedforward control requires a great deal of information about the biomechanical behavior of the limb. For the upper extremity, an artificial motor program was developed to provide such movement program input to a neuroprosthesis. In lower extremity control, one group achieved their best results by attempting to meet naturally perceived gait objectives rather than to follow an exact joint angle trajectory. Adaptive feedforward control, as implemented in the cycle-to-cycle controller, gave good compensation for the gradual decrease in performance observed with open-loop control. A neural network controller was able to control its system to customize stimulation parameters in order to generate a desired output trajectory in a given individual and to maintain tracking performance in the presence of muscle fatigue. The authors believe that practical FNS control systems must exhibit many of these features of neurophysiological systems."

In this study, a myoelectrically controlled robotic system with 1 degree-of-freedom was developed to assist elbow training in a horizontal plane with intention involvement for people after stroke. The system could provide continuous assistance in extension torque, which was proportional to the amplitude of the subject's electromyographic (EMG) signal from the triceps, and could provide resistive torques during movement. This study investigated the system's effect on restoring the upper limb functions of eight subjects after chronic stroke in a twenty-session rehabilitation training program. In each session, there were 18 trials comprising different combinations of assistive and resistive torques and an evaluation trial. Each trial consisted of five cycles of repetitive elbow flexion and extension between 90 degrees and 0 degrees at a constant velocity of 10 degrees/s. With the assistive extension torque, subjects could reach a more extended position in the first session. After 20 sessions of training, there were statistically significant improvements in the modified Ashworth scale, Fugl-Meyer scale for shoulder and elbow, motor status scale, elbow extension range, muscle strength, and root mean square error between actual elbow angle and target angle. The results showed that the twenty-session training program improved upper limb functions."

Behaviors such as learned nonuse hinder hemiplegic stroke survivors from the full use of both arms in activities of daily living. Active force-feedback cues, designed to restrain the use of the less-affected arm, were embedded into a meaningful driving simulation environment to create robot-assisted therapy device, driver's simulation environment for arm therapy (SEAT). The study hypothesized that force-feedback control mode could \"motivate\" stroke survivors to increase the productive use of their impaired arm throughout a bilateral steering task, by providing motivating feedback and reinforcement cues to reduce the overuse of the less-affected arm. Experimental results demonstrate that the force cues counteracted the tendency of hemiplegic subjects to produce counter-productive torques only during bilateral steering tasks (p < 0.05) that required the movement of their impaired arm in steering directions up and against gravity. Impaired arm activity was quantified in terms of torques due to the measured tangential forces on the split-steering wheel of driver's SEAT during bilateral steering. Results were verified using surface electromyograms recorded from key muscles in the impaired arm."

Although several MNPs are commercially available, there are issues that limit their use in therapy and/or daily assistance: (1) the users' intention of what and how to move needs to be effectively transmitted to the MNP controller; (2) interface to the neural pathways that leads to physiological-like activation should be improved; (3) artificial control of the MNP should match the biological control of the preserved biological systems; and (4) sensors information should be fused and provided to both the controller of the MNP and the user. We suggest that with the improved use of cortical or other physiological signals, application of multipad electrodes with special protocols, rule-based control that mimics biological control, and with the incorporation of micro- and nanotechnologies, wireless communications, and microcontrollers, the MNP operation can be greatly enhanced. The chapter specifically addresses the control of MNP for the upper extremities and provides details on the new surface multipad electrodes that are of interest for neurorehabilitation of stroke patients."

Following spinal cord injury (SCI), motor and sensory connections between the brain and parts of the body below-the-lesion level are partially or totally impaired.\nObjective: The present investigation is a descriptive study aimed to investigate whether people living with SCI may experience movement illusions comparable to a control group.\nMethods: Healthy and people with SCI were asked to report on three illusion-related features (Vividness, Duration, Illusory Extension) after receiving 70 Hz TV on the biceps brachii tendon of both arms. Two different forces of stimulation were applied: 2.4 N and 4.2 N.\nResults: Both patients and controls were susceptible to the kinesthetic illusion. However patients presented lower sensitivity to TV than healthy subjects. Participants rated stronger illusions of movement after 4.2 N than 2.4 N stimulation in all the three illusion-related features. Further, patients reported atypical illusory experiences of movement (e.g. as if the arm wanted to extend, or a sensation of pushing against something) that may reflect different reorganization processes following spinal cord injury.\nConclusion: The study provides a preliminary evidence of the possible use of the proprioceptive stimulation in the upper limbs of people living with SCI. Results are discussed in the light of recent advancements of brain-computer applications based on motor imagery for the control of neuroprosthetic and robotic devices in patients with severe sensorimotor deficits."

We searched Medline, CINAHL, Embase and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials. The reference lists of the previously selected articles were then examined by hand. Only studies comparing biomechanical and clinical outcomes were selected. Review, anatomical studies, letter to editor and instructional course were excluded. Finally, all the resulting articles were reviewed and discussed by all the authors to further confirm their suitability for this review: in the end, 22 articles were included. A total of 532 patients presenting a mean age of 34.3 years were studied. All patients evaluated were healthy or amateur sports except in two studies where only obese subjects and knee osteoarthritis patients were involved. Seven studies evaluated only male subjects, whereas four studies evaluated only female. Twelve of twenty-two studies performed electromyographic analyses. Weight was reported in 19 studies, whereas body mass index were reported only in a five studies. All studies reported kinematic analysis of shoe effects and compared the relationship between muscle recruitment and electromyographic activity. Unstable footwears were shown to immediately alter the stability in gait during daily-life activities. The center of body pressure is moved posteriorly with a consequent posterior displacement of the upper part of body in order to regain an appropriate body balance, and these postural changes are associated with an overall increase in the activity of lumbar erector spine muscles, as well as certain lower limb muscles. Current literature provides enough cues to conclude for a beneficial role of MBT shoes in the postural and proprioceptive recovery, but from the same literature cannot be drown clear and appropriate guidance to determine more in detail their indication for specific pathological conditions or for particular phases of the musculoskeletal recovery process."

    "abstract": "Robotic technology can provide innovative responses to the severe challenges of providing cost-effective care to restore sensory-motor function following neurological and biomechanical injury. It may be deployed at several points on a continuum of care, to provide precisely controlled sensory-motor therapy to ameliorate disability and promote recovery of function, or to provide assistance to compensate for functions that cannot be recovered, or to replace limbs lost irretrievably. This chapter reviews recent progress using robotic technology to capitalize on neural plasticity and promote recovery after neurological injury such as stroke (cerebral vascular accident), research on brain-computer interfaces as a source of control signals for assistive technologies, and research on high-performance multiple-degree-of-freedom upper-extremity prosthetic limbs."

    "title": "Wireless radio channel for intramuscular electrode implants in the control of upper limb prostheses",
    "abstract": "In the last few years the use of implanted devices has been considered also in the field of myoelectric hand prostheses. Wireless implanted EMG (Electromyogram) sensors can improve the functioning of the prosthesis, providing information without the disadvantage of the wires, and the usability by amputees. The solutions proposed in the literature are based on proprietary communication protocols between the implanted devices and the prosthesis controller, using frequency bands that are already assigned to other purposes. This study proposes the use of a standard communication protocol (IEEE 802.15.6), specific for wireless body area networks (WBANs), which assign a specific bandwidth to implanted devices. The propagation losses from in-to-on body were investigated by numerical simulation with a 3D human model and an electromagnetic solver. The channel model resulting from the study represents the first step towards the development of myoelectric prosthetic hands which are driven by signals acquired by implanted sensors. However these results can provide important information to researchers for further developments, and manufacturers, which can decrease the production costs for hand prostheses having a common standard of communication with assigned frequencies of operation."

    "title": "Volitional walking via upper limb muscle-controlled stimulation of the lumbar locomotor center in man",
    "abstract": "Gait disturbance in individuals with spinal cord lesion is attributed to the interruption of descending pathways to the spinal locomotor center, whereas neural circuits below and above the lesion maintain their functional capability. An artificial neural connection (ANC), which bridges supraspinal centers and locomotor networks in the lumbar spinal cord beyond the lesion site, may restore the functional impairment. To achieve an ANC that sends descending voluntary commands to the lumbar locomotor center and bypasses the thoracic spinal cord, upper limb muscle activity was converted to magnetic stimuli delivered noninvasively over the lumbar vertebra. Healthy participants were able to initiate and terminate walking-like behavior and to control the step cycle through an ANC controlled by volitional upper limb muscle activity. The walking-like behavior stopped just after the ANC was disconnected from the participants even when the participant continued to swing arms. Furthermore, additional simultaneous peripheral electrical stimulation to the foot via the ANC enhanced this walking-like behavior. Kinematics of the induced behaviors were identical to those observed in voluntary walking. These results demonstrate that the ANC induces volitionally controlled, walking-like behavior of the legs. This paradigm may be able to compensate for the dysfunction of descending pathways by sending commands to the preserved locomotor center at the lumbar spinal cord and may enable individuals with paraplegia to regain volitionally controlled walking."

    "abstract": "Aim: Upper-extremity interventions for hemiparesis are a challenging aspect of stroke rehabilitation. Purpose of this paper is to report the feasibility of using virtual environments (VEs) in combination with robotics to assist recovery of hand-arm function and to present preliminary data demonstrating the potential of using sensory manipulations in VE to drive activation in targeted neural regions.\nMethods: We trained 8 subjects for 8 three hour sessions using a library of complex VE's integrated with robots, comparing training arm and hand separately to training arm and hand together. Instrumented gloves and hand exoskeleton were used for hand tracking and haptic effects. Haptic Master robotic arm was used for arm tracking and generating three-dimensional haptic VEs. To investigate the use of manipulations in VE to drive neural activations, we created a \"virtual mirror\" that subjects used while performing a unimanual task. Cortical activation was measured with functional MRI (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation.\nResults: Both groups showed improvement in kinematics and measures of real-world function. The group trained using their arm and hand together showed greater improvement. In a stroke subject, fMRI data suggested virtual mirror feedback could activate the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the reflected hand (ipsilateral to the moving hand) thus recruiting the lesioned hemisphere.\nConclusion: Gaming simulations interfaced with robotic devices provide a training medium that can modify movement patterns. In addition to showing that our VE therapies can optimize behavioral performance, we show preliminary evidence to support the potential of using specific sensory manipulations to selectively recruit targeted neural circuits."

    "title": "An EMG-controlled neuroprosthesis for daily upper limb support: a preliminary study",
    "abstract": "MUNDUS is an assistive platform for recovering direct interaction capability of severely impaired people based on upper limb motor functions. Its main concept is to exploit any residual control of the end-user, thus being suitable for long term utilization in daily activities. MUNDUS integrates multimodal information (EMG, eye tracking, brain computer interface) to control different actuators, such as a passive exoskeleton for weight relief, a neuroprosthesis for arm motion and small motors for grasping. Within this project, the present work integreted a commercial passive exoskeleton with an EMG-controlled neuroprosthesis for supporting hand-to-mouth movements. Being the stimulated muscle the same from which the EMG was measured, first it was necessary to develop an appropriate digital filter to separate the volitional EMG and the stimulation response. Then, a control method aimed at exploiting as much as possible the residual motor control of the end-user was designed. The controller provided a stimulation intensity proportional to the volitional EMG. An experimental protocol was defined to validate the filter and the controller operation on one healthy volunteer. The subject was asked to perform a sequence of hand-to-mouth movements holding different loads. The movements were supported by both the exoskeleton and the neuroprosthesis. The filter was able to detect an increase of the volitional EMG as the weight held by the subject increased. Thus, a higher stimulation intensity was provided in order to support a more intense exercise. The study demonstrated the feasibility of an EMG-controlled neuroprosthesis for daily upper limb support on healthy subjects, providing a first step forward towards the development of the final MUNDUS platform."

    "title": "Two ways to improve myoelectric control for a transhumeral amputee after targeted muscle reinnervation: a case study",
    "abstract": "Background: Myoelectric control of multifunctional prostheses is challenging for individuals with high-level amputations due to insufficient surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. A surgical technique called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) has achieved impressive improvements in myoelectric control by providing more sEMG control signals. In this case, some channels of sEMG signals are coupled after TMR, which limits the performance of conventional amplitude-based control for upper-limb prostheses.\nMethods: In this paper, two different ways (training and algorithms) were attempted to solve the problem in a transhumeral amputee after TMR. Firstly, effect of rehabilitation training on generating independent sEMG signals was investigated. The results indicated that some sEMG signals recorded were still coupled over the targeted muscles after rehabilitation training for about two months. Secondly, pattern recognition (PR) algorithm was then applied to classify the sEMG signals. In the second way, to further improve the real-time performance of prosthetic control, a post-processing method named as mean absolute value-based (MAV-based) threshold switches was utilized.\nResults: Using the improved algorithms, substantial improvement was shown in a subset of the modified Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). Compared with common PR control without post-processing method, the total scores increased more than 18% with majority vote and more than 58% with MAV-based threshold switches. The amputee was able to finish all the tasks within the allotted time with the standard MAV-based threshold switches. Subjectively the amputee preferred the PR control with MAV-based threshold switches and reported it to be more accurate and much smoother both in experiment and practical use.\nConclusions: Although the sEMG signals were still coupled after rehabilitation training on the TMR patient, the online performance of the prosthetic operation was improved through application of PR control with combination of the MAV-based threshold switches.\nTrial registration: Retrospectively registered http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=22058 ."

    "title": "Simulating the impact of sensorimotor deficits on reaching performance",
    "abstract": "The healthy human nervous system accurately and robustly controls movements despite nonlinear dynamics, noise, and delays. After a stroke, motor ability frequently becomes impaired. To provide insight into the relative impact of specific sensorimotor deficits on motor performance, we modeled neural control of reaching with the human upper limb as a near-optimally feedback-controlled two-degree-of-freedom system with biologically based parameters. We added three sensorimotor impairments commonly associated with post-stroke hemiparesis - abnormal joint coupling, increased noise on internally modeled dynamics, and muscular weakness - and examined the impact on reaching performance. We found that abnormal joint coupling unknown to the system's internal model caused systematic perturbations to trajectories, longer reach durations, and target overshoot. Increasing internal model noise and muscular weakness had little impact on motor performance unless model noise was increased by several orders of magnitude. Many reaches performed by our perturbed models replicate features commonly observed in reaches by hemiparetic stroke survivors. The sensitivity to unmodeled abnormal joint coupling agrees with experimental findings that abnormal coupling (possibly related to internal model errors) is the main cause of post-stroke motor impairment."

    "title": "Moving sounds within the peripersonal space modulate the motor system",
    "abstract": "Interactions between ourselves and the external world are mediated by a multisensory representation of the space surrounding the body, i.e. the peripersonal space (PPS). In particular, a special interplay is observed among tactile stimuli delivered on a body part, e.g. the hand, and visual or auditory external inputs presented close, but not far, from the same body part, e.g. within hand PPS. This coding of multisensory stimuli as a function of their distance from the hand has a role in upper limb actions. However, it remains unclear whether PPS representation affects the motor system only when stimuli occur specifically at the hand location or when they move within a continuous portion of space where the hand can potentially act. Here, in order to study these two alternatively hypotheses, we assessed the critical distance at which moving sounds have a direct effect on hand corticospinal excitability by using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Specifically, TMS single pulses were delivered when a sound source was perceived at six different positions in space: from very close to subjects' hand (15 cm) to far away (90 cm). Moreover, sound direction was manipulated to test if stimuli approaching and receding from the hand might have the same relevance for the motor system. MEPs amplitude was enhanced when sounds were delivered within a limited distance from the hand (around 60 cm) as compared to when the sounds were beyond this space. This effect captures the spatial boundaries within which PPS representation modulates hand cortico-motor excitability. This spatially-dependent modulation of corticospinal activity was not further affected by the sound direction. Such findings support a strict link between the multisensory representation of the space around the body and the motor representation of potential approaching or defensive acts within that space."

    "title": "Vibrotactile detection thresholds for chest skin of amputees following targeted reinnervation surgery",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in the design of prosthetic arms have helped upper limb amputees achieve greater levels of function. However, control of upper limb prostheses is limited by the lack of sensory feedback to the user. Targeted reinnervation, a novel surgical technique for amputees, offers the potential for returning this lost sensation. During targeted reinnervation surgery, truncated nerves are directed to reinnervate new muscle and skin sites. Contractions of reinnervated muscles generate electrical signals that are used to control prosthetic arms. In addition, stimulation of reinnervated skin is perceived on the missing limb. Vibration detection thresholds were measured at four frequencies on the reinnervated chest skin of three shoulder-level amputees following targeted reinnervation surgery. Thresholds were also measured on the contralateral chest and arm skin of these amputees, as well as on the chest and arm skin of a control population. Vibrations applied to reinnervated skin were perceived at various locations on the missing arm and hand. Thresholds for the reinnervated chest skin were generally within the range of values measured on the chests of the control population. For the two unilateral amputees, these thresholds were similar to measures on their contralateral chests, but greater than measures on their contralateral hands. Targeted reinnervation appears to result in near-normal vibration-detection ability with respect to the target tissue, suggesting the functional reinnervation of mechanoreceptors by the reinnervating afferents. The functional limb sensation following targeted reinnervation could be used to provide prosthesis users with a sense of touch."

    "title": "Lesion locations associated with persistent proprioceptive impairment in the upper limbs after stroke",
    "abstract": "Proprioceptive deficits are common after stroke and have been associated with poorer recovery. Relatively little is known about the brain regions beyond primary somatosensory cortex that contribute to the percept of proprioception in humans. We examined a large sample (n = 153) of stroke survivors longitudinally to determine which brain regions were associated with persistent post-stroke proprioceptive deficits. A robotic exoskeleton quantified two components of proprioception, position sense and kinesthesia (movement sense), at 2 weeks and again at 6 months post-stroke. A statistical region of interest (sROI) analysis compared the lesion-behaviour relationships of those subjects with cortical and subcortical stroke (n = 136). The impact of damage to brainstem and cerebellum (n = 17) was examined separately. Results indicate that damage to the supramarginal gyrus, the arcuate fasciculus, and Heschl's gyrus are associated with deficits in position sense and kinesthesia at 6 months post-stroke. These results suggest that regions beyond the primary somatosensory cortex contribute to our sense of limb position and movement. This information extends our understanding of proprioceptive processing and may inform personalized interventions such as non-invasive brain stimulation where specific brain regions can be targeted to potentially improve stroke recovery."

    "abstract": "Interlimb neural coupling might underlie human bipedal locomotion, which is reflected in the fact that people swing their arms synchronously with leg movement in normal gait. Therefore, arm swing should be included in gait training to provide coordinated interlimb performance. The present study aimed to develop a Rotational Orthosis for Walking with Arm Swing (ROWAS), and evaluate its feasibility from the perspectives of implementation, acceptability and responsiveness. We developed the mechanical structures of the ROWAS system in SolidWorks, and implemented the concept in a prototype. Normal gait data were used as the reference performance of the shoulder, hip, knee and ankle joints of the prototype. The ROWAS prototype was tested for function assessment and further evaluated using five able-bodied subjects for user feedback. The ROWAS prototype produced coordinated performance in the upper and lower limbs, with joint profiles similar to those occurring in normal gait. The subjects reported a stronger feeling of walking with arm swing than without. The ROWAS system was deemed feasible according to the formal assessment criteria."

    "abstract": "For the purpose of bimanual control of tetraplegic hands that have useful movement restored by a neuroprosthetic device, the use of myoelectric signals from bilateral sternoclei-domastoid muscles is proposed. Three state control has been proposed where each sternocleidomastoid controls its ipsilateral hand. Demonstration was made with spinal-cord-injured and nonspinal-cord-injured subjects providing three levels of activation that can be repeatably made with each of these muscles. The agonist and antagonist sternocleidomastoids during this command control were differentiated so that the desired hand will respond to a command. Neither normal head movements nor head position within its comfortable range of motion were shown to interfere with the proposed command. The provision of feedback was shown as important to provide robustness in the operation for the users selection of the right or left hand. The performance of spinal cord injured and noninjured persons using this controller was quantitatively measured through the completion of precision tracking tasks by the manipulation of on-screen virtual hands. All subjects were able to operate the controller with a degree of skill acceptable for completion of functional tasks with bilateral stimulated hand grasps. The sensitivity of the subjects performance to variation in controller parameters was also measured."

Different from most of the existing position control approaches, this paper develops force control methods to make the exoskeleton robot behave like humans in order to provide better assistance. The exoskeleton robot is directly attached to a user's body and activated by the sEMG signals of the user's muscles, which reflect the user's motion intention. In the first proposed control method, the forces of agonist and antagonist muscles pair are estimated, and their difference is used to produce the torque of the corresponding joints. In the second method, linear discriminant analysis-based classifiers are introduced as the indicator of the motion type of the joints. Then, the classifier's outputs together with the estimated force of corresponding active muscle determine the torque control signals. Different from the conventional approaches, one classifier is assigned to each joint, which decreases the training time and largely simplifies the recognition process. Finally, the extensive experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."

    "abstract": "Background: Myoelectric prostheses lack a strong human-machine interface, leading to high abandonment rates in upper limb amputees. Implantable wireless electromyography systems improve control by recording signals directly from muscle, compared with surface electromyography. These devices do not exist for high amputation levels. In this article, the authors present an implantable wireless electromyography system for these scenarios tested in Merino sheep for 4 months.\nMethods: In a pilot trial, the electrodes were implanted in the hind limbs of 24 Sprague-Dawley rats. After 8 or 12 weeks, impedance and histocompatibility were assessed. In the main trial, the system was tested in four Merino sheep for 4 months. Impedance of the electrodes was analyzed in two animals. Electromyographic data were analyzed in two freely moving animals repeatedly during forward and backward gait.\nResults: Device implantation was successful in all 28 animals. Histologic evaluation showed a tight encapsulation after 8 weeks of 78.2 ± 26.5 µm subcutaneously and 92.9 ± 31.3 µm on the muscular side. Electromyographic recordings show a distinct activation pattern of the triceps, brachialis, and latissimus dorsi muscles, with a low signal-to-noise ratio, representing specific patterns of agonist and antagonist activation. Average electrode impedance decreased over the whole frequency range, indicating an improved electrode-tissue interface during the implantation. All measurements taken over the 4 months of observation used identical settings and showed similar recordings despite changing environmental factors.\nConclusion: This study shows the implantation of this electromyography device as a promising alternative to surface electromyography, providing a potentially powerful wireless interface for high-level amputees."

    "abstract": "Objective: Recent studies have shown the possibility of simultaneous and proportional control of electrically powered upper-limb prostheses, but there has been little investigation on optimal channel selection. The objective of this study is to find a robust channel selection method and the channel subsets most suitable for simultaneous and proportional myoelectric prosthesis control of multiple degrees-of-freedom (DoFs).\nApproach: Ten able-bodied subjects and one person with congenital upper-limb deficiency took part in this study, and performed wrist movements with various combinations of two DoFs (flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation). During the experiment, high density electromyographic (EMG) signals and the actual wrist angles were recorded with an 8 × 24 electrode array and a motion tracking system, respectively. The wrist angles were estimated from EMG features with ridge regression using the subsets of channels chosen by three different channel selection methods: (1) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), (2) sequential feature selection (SFS), and (3) uniform selection (UNI).\nMain results: SFS generally showed higher estimation accuracy than LASSO and UNI, but LASSO always outperformed SFS in terms of robustness, such as noise addition, channel shift and training data reduction. It was also confirmed that about 95% of the original performance obtained using all channels can be retained with only 12 bipolar channels individually selected by LASSO and SFS.\nSignificance: From the analysis results, it can be concluded that LASSO is a promising channel selection method for accurate simultaneous and proportional prosthesis control. We expect that our results will provide a useful guideline to select optimal channel subsets when developing clinical myoelectric prosthesis control systems based on continuous movements with multiple DoFs."

    "title": "Upper limb amputees can be induced to experience a rubber hand as their own",
    "abstract": "We describe how upper limb amputees can be made to experience a rubber hand as part of their own body. This was accomplished by applying synchronous touches to the stump, which was out of view, and to the index finger of a rubber hand, placed in full view (26 cm medial to the stump). This elicited an illusion of sensing touch on the artificial hand, rather than on the stump and a feeling of ownership of the rubber hand developed. This effect was supported by quantitative subjective reports in the form of questionnaires, behavioural data in the form of misreaching in a pointing task when asked to localize the position of the touch, and physiological evidence obtained by skin conductance responses when threatening the hand prosthesis. Our findings outline a simple method for transferring tactile sensations from the stump to a prosthetic limb by tricking the brain, thereby making an important contribution to the field of neuroprosthetics where a major goal is to develop artificial limbs that feel like a real parts of the body."

    "abstract": "Background: Advanced motorized prosthetic devices are currently controlled by EMG signals generated by residual muscles and recorded by surface electrodes on the skin. These surface recordings are often inconsistent and unreliable, leading to high prosthetic abandonment rates for individuals with upper limb amputation. Surface electrodes are limited because of poor skin contact, socket rotation, residual limb sweating, and their ability to only record signals from superficial muscles, whose function frequently does not relate to the intended prosthetic function. More sophisticated prosthetic devices require a stable and reliable interface between the user and robotic hand to improve upper limb prosthetic function.\nNew method: Implantable Myoelectric Sensors (IMES(®)) are small electrodes intended to detect and wirelessly transmit EMG signals to an electromechanical prosthetic hand via an electro-magnetic coil built into the prosthetic socket. This system is designed to simultaneously capture EMG signals from multiple residual limb muscles, allowing the natural control of multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously.\nResults: We report the status of the first FDA-approved clinical trial of the IMES(®) System. This study is currently in progress, limiting reporting to only preliminary results.\nComparison with existing methods: Our first subject has reported the ability to accomplish a greater variety and complexity of tasks in his everyday life compared to what could be achieved with his previous myoelectric prosthesis.\nConclusion: The interim results of this study indicate the feasibility of utilizing IMES(®) technology to reliably sense and wirelessly transmit EMG signals from residual muscles to intuitively control a three degree-of-freedom prosthetic arm."

    "abstract": "Prosthetic devices have advanced in their capabilities and in the number and type of sensors included in their design. As the space of sensorimotor data available to a conventional or machine learning prosthetic control system increases in dimensionality and complexity, it becomes increasingly important that this data be represented in a useful and computationally efficient way. Well structured sensory data allows prosthetic control systems to make informed, appropriate control decisions. In this study, we explore the impact that increased sensorimotor information has on current machine learning prosthetic control approaches. Specifically, we examine the effect that high-dimensional sensory data has on the computation time and prediction performance of a true-online temporal-difference learning prediction method as embedded within a resource-limited upper-limb prosthesis control system. We present results comparing tile coding, the dominant linear representation for real-time prosthetic machine learning, with a newly proposed modification to Kanerva coding that we call selective Kanerva coding. In addition to showing promising results for selective Kanerva coding, our results confirm potential limitations to tile coding as the number of sensory input dimensions increases. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explicitly examine representations for realtime machine learning prosthetic devices in general terms. This work therefore provides an important step towards forming an efficient prosthesis-eye view of the world, wherein prompt and accurate representations of high-dimensional data may be provided to machine learning control systems within artificial limbs and other assistive rehabilitation technologies."

Constraint-induced movement therapy, a rigorous program for upper extremity weakness, has been proven effective for improving arm function. Other areas of investigation include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, cellular management, robotic therapy, and pharmacologic strategies to enhance recovery. OnabotulinumtoxinA (formerly botulinum toxin A) is effective for treating spasticity in the arm after stroke. Depression, experienced by at least one-third of patients after stroke, should be managed, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may offer an additional advantage of improved motor recovery. Proven interventions for secondary prevention after stroke include carotid revascularization, anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation, aggressive medical management for those with significant intracranial atherosclerosis, statin treatment for patients with atherosclerotic stroke and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 100 to 190 mg/dL, antiplatelet therapy for nonatrial fibrillation stroke, and blood pressure reduction. Vitamin and dietary supplements are of unproven benefit for stroke patients. Exercise, smoking cessation, and a healthful diet should be encouraged.

The proposed technique allows a fast contingent and proportionally modulated stimulation of afferent proprioceptive and motor output neural pathways using operant learning. Continuous and immediate assisted-feedback of force proportional to rolandic rhythm oscillations during actual movements was employed and illustrated with a single case experiment. One hemiplegic patient was trained for 2 weeks coupling somatosensory brain oscillations with force-field control during a robot-mediated center-out motor-task whose execution approaches movements of everyday life. The robot facilitated actual movements adding a modulated force directed to the target, thus providing a non-delayed proprioceptive feedback. Neuro-electric, kinematic, and motor-behavioral measures were recorded in pre- and post-assessments without force assistance. Patient's healthy arm was used as control since neither a placebo control was possible nor other control conditions. We observed a generalized and significant kinematic improvement in the affected arm and a spatial accuracy improvement in both arms, together with an increase and focalization of the somatosensory rhythm changes used to provide assisted-force-feedback. The interpretation of the neurophysiological and kinematic evidences reported here is strictly related to the repetition of the motor-task and the presence of the assisted-force-feedback. Results are described as systematic observations only, without firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the methodology. In this prototypical view, the design of appropriate control conditions is discussed. This study presents a novel operant-learning-based BMI-application for motor-training coupling brain oscillations and force feedback during an actual movement."

The aim of this study is to quantify the influence of high cable forces on object manipulation with voluntary-closing prostheses.\nMethod: Able-bodied male subjects were fitted with a bypass-prosthesis with low and high cable force settings for the prehensor. Subjects were requested to grasp and transfer a collapsible object as fast as they could without dropping or breaking it. The object had a low and a high breaking force setting.\nResults: Subjects conducted significantly more successful manipulations with the low cable force setting, both for the low (33% more) and high (50%) object's breaking force. The time to complete the task was not different between settings during successful manipulation trials.\nConclusion: High cable forces lead to reduced pinch force control during object manipulation. This implies that low cable operation forces should be a key design requirement for voluntary-closing BPPs."

    "title": "Semi-Autonomous Robotic Arm Reaching With Hybrid Gaze-Brain Machine Interface",
    "abstract": "Recent developments in the non-muscular human-robot interface (HRI) and shared control strategies have shown potential for controlling the assistive robotic arm by people with no residual movement or muscular activity in upper limbs. However, most non-muscular HRIs only produce discrete-valued commands, resulting in non-intuitive and less effective control of the dexterous assistive robotic arm. Furthermore, the user commands and the robot autonomy commands usually switch in the shared control strategies of such applications. This characteristic has been found to yield a reduced sense of agency as well as frustration for the user according to previous user studies. In this study, we firstly propose an intuitive and easy-to-learn-and-use hybrid HRI by combing the Brain-machine interface (BMI) and the gaze-tracking interface. For the proposed hybrid gaze-BMI, the continuous modulation of the movement speed via the motor intention occurs seamlessly and simultaneously to the unconstrained movement direction control with the gaze signals. We then propose a shared control paradigm that always combines user input and the autonomy with the dynamic combination regulation. The proposed hybrid gaze-BMI and shared control paradigm were validated for a robotic arm reaching task performed with healthy subjects. All the users were able to employ the hybrid gaze-BMI for moving the end-effector sequentially to reach the target across the horizontal plane while also avoiding collisions with obstacles. The shared control paradigm maintained as much volitional control as possible, while providing the assistance for the most difficult parts of the task. The presented semi-autonomous robotic system yielded continuous, smooth, and collision-free motion trajectories for the end effector approaching the target. Compared to a system without assistances from robot autonomy, it significantly reduces the rate of failure as well as the time and effort spent by the user to complete the tasks."

    "title": "Automating arm movement training following severe stroke: functional exercises with quantitative feedback in a gravity-reduced environment",
    "abstract": "An important goal in rehabilitation engineering is to develop technology that allows individuals with severe motor impairment to practice arm movement without continuous supervision from a rehabilitation therapist. This paper describes the development of such a system, called Therapy WREX or (\"T-WREX\"). The system consists of an orthosis that assists in arm movement across a large workspace, a grip sensor that detects hand grip pressure, and software that simulates functional activities. The arm orthosis is an instrumented, adult-sized version of the Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton (WREX), which is a five degrees-of-freedom mechanism that passively counterbalances the weight of the arm using elastic bands. After providing a detailed design description of T-WREX, this paper describes two pilot studies of the system's capabilities. The first study demonstrated that individuals with chronic stroke whose arm function is compromised in a normal gravity environment can perform reaching and drawing movements while using T-WREX. The second study demonstrated that exercising the affected arm of five people with chronic stroke with T-WREX over an eight week period improved unassisted movement ability (mean change in Fugl-Meyer score was 5 points +/- 2 SD; mean change in range of motion of reaching was 10%, p < 0.001). These results demonstrate the feasibility of automating upper-extremity rehabilitation therapy for people with severe stroke using passive gravity assistance, a grip sensor, and simple virtual reality software."

    "abstract": "For individuals with a high spinal cord injury (SCI) not only the lower limbs, but also the upper extremities are paralyzed. A neuroprosthesis can be used to restore the lost hand and arm function in those tetraplegics. The main problem for this group of individuals, however, is the reduced ability to voluntarily operate device controllers. A brain-computer interface provides a non-manual alternative to conventional input devices by translating brain activity patterns into control commands. We show that the temporal coding of individual mental imagery pattern can be used to control two independent degrees of freedom - grasp and elbow function - of an artificial robotic arm by utilizing a minimum number of EEG scalp electrodes. We describe the procedure from the initial screening to the final application. From eight naïve subjects participating online feedback experiments, four were able to voluntarily control an artificial arm by inducing one motor imagery pattern derived from one EEG derivation only."

    "title": "Directional Forgetting for Stable Co-Adaptation in Myoelectric Control",
    "abstract": "Conventional myoelectric controllers provide a mapping between electromyographic signals and prosthetic functions. However, due to a number of instabilities continuously challenging this process, an initial mapping may require an extended calibration phase with long periods of user-training in order to ensure satisfactory performance. Recently, studies on co-adaptation have highlighted the benefits of concurrent user learning and machine adaptation where systems can cope with deficiencies in the initial model by learning from newly acquired data. However, the success remains highly dependent on careful weighting of these new data. In this study, we proposed a function driven directional forgetting approach to the recursive least-squares algorithm as opposed to the classic exponential forgetting scheme. By only discounting past information in the same direction of the new data, local corrections to the mapping would induce less distortion to other regions. To validate the approach, subjects performed a set of real-time myoelectric tasks over a range of forgetting factors. Results show that directional forgetting with a forgetting factor of 0.995 outperformed exponential forgetting as well as unassisted user learning. Moreover, myoelectric control remained stable after adaptation with directional forgetting over a range of forgetting factors. These results indicate that a directional approach to discounting past training data can improve performance and alleviate sensitivities to parameter selection in recursive adaptation algorithms."

    "abstract": "Objective: To show that it is possible to determine segment masses and segment centers of mass by measuring manipulator-hand contact forces and joint angles during upper extremity movement.\nBackground: The method serves as a quick subject specific body segment parameter evaluation technique. Clinically we see this method as an alternative upper extremity body segment parameter evaluation study especially useful in rehabilitation treatment activities.\nMethods: The experiment is based on coupling the human arm with a robotic manipulator which is then used for imposing a specified sagittal plane trajectory. Joint angles and forces in the contact point serve as input to the identification procedure. For verification purposes the proposed identification procedure was first performed on a mechanical arm. Afterwards a low velocity trajectory was imposed into all joints of the human upper extremity, with very small angular deviations. Within this small angular region the arm was assumed to be represented as a linear system.\nFindings: The outcome of the identification procedure is an estimate of masses and center of mass coordinates for the lower arm and palm segments, their products for the upper arm and the passive moments around the measured angle of all joints in the sagittal plane. The results obtained for three particular human arms are eventually compared to the average population based literature.\nConclusion: From the clinical point of view the study can become useful for biomechanical evaluation and for evaluating biomechanical properties of lower extremities or other body segments. This method may also provide a foundation to measuring body segment moments of inertia and joint viscoelastic parameters."

    "title": "Upper extremity limb loss: functional restoration from prosthesis and targeted reinnervation to transplantation",
    "abstract": "For several decades, prosthetic use was the only option to restore function after upper extremity amputation. Recent years have seen advances in the field of prosthetics. Such advances include prosthetic design and function, activity-specific devices, improved aesthetics, and adjunctive surgical procedures to improve both form and function. Targeted reinnervation is one exciting advance that allows for more facile and more intuitive function with prosthetics following proximal amputation. Another remarkable advance that holds great promise in nearly all fields of medicine is the transplantation of composite tissue, such as hand and face transplantation. Hand transplantation holds promise as the ultimate restorative procedure that can provide form, function, and sensation. However, this procedure still comes with a substantial cost in terms of the rehabilitation and toxic immunosuppression and should be limited to carefully selected patients who have failed prosthetic reconstruction. Hand transplantation and prosthetic reconstruction should not be viewed as competing options. Rather, they are two treatment options with different risk/benefit profiles and different indications and, hence vastly different implications."

    "abstract": "Background: Controlling a myoelectric prosthesis for upper limbs is increasingly challenging for the user as more electrodes and joints become available. Motion classification based on pattern recognition with a multi-electrode array allows multiple joints to be controlled simultaneously. Previous pattern recognition studies are difficult to compare, because individual research groups use their own data sets. To resolve this shortcoming and to facilitate comparisons, open access data sets were analysed using components of BioPatRec and Netlab pattern recognition models.\nMethods: Performances of the artificial neural networks, linear models, and training program components were compared. Evaluation took place within the BioPatRec environment, a Matlab-based open source platform that provides feature extraction, processing and motion classification algorithms for prosthetic control. The algorithms were applied to myoelectric signals for individual and simultaneous classification of movements, with the aim of finding the best performing algorithm and network model. Evaluation criteria included classification accuracy and training time.\nResults: Results in both the linear and the artificial neural network models demonstrated that Netlab's implementation using scaled conjugate training algorithm reached significantly higher accuracies than BioPatRec.\nConclusions: It is concluded that the best movement classification performance would be achieved through integrating Netlab training algorithms in the BioPatRec environment so that future prosthesis training can be shortened and control made more reliable. Netlab was therefore included into the newest release of BioPatRec (v4.0)."

    "abstract": "Early decoding of motor states directly from the brain activity is essential to develop brain-machine interfaces (BMI) for natural motor control of neuroprosthetic devices. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the detection of movement information before the actual movement occurs. This information piece could be useful to provide early control signals to drive BMI-based rehabilitation and motor assisted devices, thus providing a natural and active rehabilitation therapy. In this work, electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals from six healthy right-handed participants were recorded during self-initiated reaching movements of the upper limbs. The analysis of these EEG traces showed that significant event-related desynchronization is present before and during the execution of the movements, predominantly in the motor-related α and β frequency bands and in electrodes placed above the motor cortex. This oscillatory brain activity was used to continuously detect the intention to move the limbs, that is, to identify the motor phase prior to the actual execution of the reaching movement. The results showed, first, significant classification between relax and movement intention and, second, significant detection of movement intention prior to the onset of the executed movement. On the basis of these results, detection of movement intention could be used in BMI settings to reduce the gap between mental motor processes and the actual movement performed by an assisted or rehabilitation robotic device."

    "abstract": "Touch perception on the fingers and hand is essential for fine motor control, contributes to our sense of self, allows for effective communication, and aids in our fundamental perception of the world. Despite increasingly sophisticated mechatronics, prosthetic devices still do not directly convey sensation back to their wearers. We show that implanted peripheral nerve interfaces in two human subjects with upper limb amputation provided stable, natural touch sensation in their hands for more than 1 year. Electrical stimulation using implanted peripheral nerve cuff electrodes that did not penetrate the nerve produced touch perceptions at many locations on the phantom hand with repeatable, stable responses in the two subjects for 16 and 24 months. Patterned stimulation intensity produced a sensation that the subjects described as natural and without \"tingling,\" or paresthesia. Different patterns produced different types of sensory perception at the same location on the phantom hand. The two subjects reported tactile perceptions they described as natural tapping, constant pressure, light moving touch, and vibration. Changing average stimulation intensity controlled the size of the percept area; changing stimulation frequency controlled sensation strength. Artificial touch sensation improved the subjects' ability to control grasping strength of the prosthesis and enabled them to better manipulate delicate objects. Thus, electrical stimulation through peripheral nerve electrodes produced long-term sensory restoration after limb loss."

In this paper, we describe the design and modes of operation of a robot-based rehabilitation framework that enables artificial support of the sensorimotor feedback loop. The aim is to increase cortical plasticity by means of Hebbian-type learning rules. A BCI-based shared-control strategy is used to drive a Barret WAM 7-degree-of-freedom arm that guides a subject's arm. Experimental validation of our setup is carried out both with healthy subjects and stroke patients. We review the empirical results which we have obtained to date, and argue that they support the feasibility of future rehabilitative treatments employing this novel approach."

Whilst there are a number of contributing factors, it is obvious that the treating clinician should have a clear understanding of the objectives and limitations of robotic device use. This study sought to explore how devices can be developed to support a clinician in providing clinical best practice.Methods and Materials: A user-centred design study of a robotic device was conducted, involving build-then-use iterations, where successive iterations are built based on feedback from the use cycle. This work reports results of an analysis of qualitative and quantitative data describing the use of the robotic device in the clinical sessions, and from a focus group with the treating clinicians.Results and Conclusions: The data indicated that use of the device did not result in patient goal-setting and may have resulted in poor movement quality. Therapists expected a higher level of autonomy from the robotic device, and this may have contributed to the above problems. These problems can and should be addressed through modification of both the study design and device to provide more explicit instructions to promote clinical best practice.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONEncouraging clinical best practice when using evaluating prototype devices within a clinical setting is important to ensure that best practice is maintained - and can be achieved through both study and device designSupport from device developers can significantly improve the confidence of therapists during the use of that device in rehabilitation, particularly with new or prototype devicesEnd effector-based robotic devices for rehabilitation show potential for a wide variety of patient presentations and capabilities."

The bone-anchored device was used as a conduit for the passage of a wire connecting an internal epimysial electrode to an external signal-recording device. The bone-anchored device was inserted into an intact tibia and the electrode attached to the adjacent M. peroneus tertius. \"Physiological\" signals with low signal-to-noise ratios were successfully obtained over a 12-week period by walking the sheep on a treadmill. Reliable transmission of multiple muscle signals across the skin barrier is essential for providing intuitive, biomimetic upper limb prostheses.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the spatio-temporal activation of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and cervical extensor (CE) muscles with respect to the deltoid muscle onset during rapid voluntary upper limb movement in healthy volunteers. The repeatability and reliability of the spatio-temporal aspects of the myoelectric signals were also examined. Ten subjects performed bilateral and unilateral rapid upper limb flexion, abduction and extension in response to a visual stimulus. EMG onsets and normalised root mean square (nRMS) values were calculated for the SCM and CE muscles. Subjects attended three testing sessions over non-consecutive days allowing the repeatability and reliability of these measures to be assessed. The SCM and CE muscles demonstrated feed-forward activation (activation within 50 ms of deltoid onset) during rapid arm movements in all directions. The sequence and magnitude of neck muscle activation displayed directional specificity, however, the neck flexor and extensor muscles displayed co-activation during all perturbations. EMG onsets demonstrated high repeatability in terms of repeated measure precision (nSEM in the range 1.9-5.7%). This was less evident for the repeatability of nRMS values. The results of this study provide a greater understanding of cervical neuromotor control strategies. During bilateral and unilateral upper limb perturbations, the SCM and CE muscles demonstrate feed-forward co-activation. It seems apparent that feed-forward activation of neck muscles is a mechanism necessary to achieve stability for the visual and vestibular systems, whilst ensuring stabilisation and protection of the cervical spine."

    "title": "Learning a novel myoelectric-controlled interface task",
    "abstract": "Control of myoelectric prostheses and brain-machine interfaces requires learning abstract neuromotor transformations. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this ability, we trained subjects to move a two-dimensional cursor using a myoelectric-controlled interface. With the upper limb immobilized, an electromyogram from multiple hand and arm muscles moved the cursor in directions that were either intuitive or nonintuitive and with high or low variability. We found that subjects could learn even nonintuitive arrangements to a high level of performance. Muscle-tuning functions were cosine shaped and modulated so as to reduce cursor variability. Subjects exhibited an additional preference for using hand muscles over arm muscles, which resulted from a greater capacity of these to form novel, task-specific synergies. In a second experiment, nonvisual feedback from the hand was degraded with amplitude- and frequency-modulated vibration. Although vibration impaired task performance, it did not affect the rate at which learning occurred. We therefore conclude that the motor system can acquire internal models of novel, abstract neuromotor mappings even in the absence of overt movements or accurate proprioceptive signals, but that the distal motor system may be better suited to provide flexible control signals for neuromotor prostheses than structures related to the arm."

    "title": "Quality parameters for a multimodal EEG/EMG/kinematic brain-computer interface (BCI) aiming to suppress neurological tremor in upper limbs",
    "abstract": "Tremor is the most common movement disorder encountered during daily neurological practice. Tremor in the upper limbs causes functional disability and social inconvenience, impairing daily life activities. The response of tremor to pharmacotherapy is variable. Therefore, a combination of drugs is often required. Surgery is considered when the response to medications is not sufficient. However, about one third of patients are refractory to current treatments. New bioengineering therapies are emerging as possible alternatives. Our study was carried out in the framework of the European project \"Tremor\" (ICT-2007-224051). The main purpose of this challenging project was to develop and validate a new treatment for upper limb tremor based on the combination of functional electrical stimulation (FES; which has been shown to reduce upper limb tremor) with a brain-computer interface (BCI). A BCI-driven detection of voluntary movement is used to trigger FES in a closed-loop approach. Neurological tremor is detected using a matrix of EMG electrodes and inertial sensors embedded in a wearable textile. The identification of the intentionality of movement is a critical aspect to optimize this complex system. We propose a multimodal detection of the intentionality of movement by fusing signals from EEG, EMG and kinematic sensors (gyroscopes and accelerometry). Parameters of prediction of movement are extracted in order to provide global prediction plots and trigger FES properly. In particular, quality parameters (QPs) for the EEG signals, corticomuscular coherence and event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) parameters are combined in an original algorithm which takes into account the refractoriness/responsiveness of tremor. A simulation study of the relationship between the threshold of ERD/ERS of artificial EEG traces and the QPs is also provided. Very interestingly, values of QPs were much greater than those obtained for the corticomuscular module alone."

    "abstract": "Surface Electromyography (EMG) is popularly used to decode human motion intention for robot movement control. Traditional motion decoding method uses pattern recognition to provide binary control command which can only move the robot as predefined limited patterns. In this work, we proposed a motion decoding method which can accurately estimate 3-dimensional (3-D) continuous upper limb motion only from multi-channel EMG signals. In order to prevent the muscle activities from motion artifacts and muscle crosstalk which especially obviously exist in upper limb motion, the independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to extract the independent source EMG signals. The motion data was also transferred from 4-manifold to 2-manifold by the principle component analysis (PCA). A hidden Markov model (HMM) was proposed to decode the motion from the EMG signals after the model trained by an adaptive model identification process. Experimental data were used to train the decoding model and validate the motion decoding performance. By comparing the decoded motion with the measured motion, it is found that the proposed motion decoding strategy was feasible to decode 3-D continuous motion from EMG signals."

    "abstract": "Wearable inertial systems have recently been used to track human movement in and outside of the laboratory. Continuous monitoring of human movement can provide valuable information relevant to individual's level of physical activity and functional ability. Traditionally, orientation has been calculated by integrating the angular velocity from gyroscopes. However, a small drift in the measured velocity leads to large integration errors that grow with time. To compensate for that drift, complementary data from accelerometers are normally fused into the tracking systems using the Kalman or extended Kalman filter (EKF). In this study, we combine kinematic models designed for control of robotic arms with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to continuously estimate the angles of human shoulder and elbow using two wearable sensors. This methodology can easily be generalized to track other human joints. We validate the method with an optical motion tracking system and demonstrate correlation consistently greater than 0.9 between the two systems."

    "title": "Sensory capacity of reinnervated skin after redirection of amputated upper limb nerves to the chest",
    "abstract": "Targeted reinnervation is a new neural-machine interface that has been developed to help improve the function of new-generation prosthetic limbs. Targeted reinnervation is a surgical procedure that takes the nerves that once innervated a severed limb and redirects them to proximal muscle and skin sites. The sensory afferents of the redirected nerves reinnervate the skin overlying the transfer site. This creates a sensory expression of the missing limb in the amputee's reinnervated skin. When these individuals are touched on this reinnervated skin they feel as though they are being touched on their missing limb. Targeted reinnervation takes nerves that once served the hand, a skin region of high functional importance, and redirects them to less functionally relevant skin areas adjacent to the amputation site. In an effort to better understand the sensory capacity of the reinnervated target skin following this procedure, we examined grating orientation thresholds and point localization thresholds on two amputees who had undergone the targeted reinnervation surgery. Grating orientation thresholds and point localization thresholds were also measured on the contralateral normal skin of the targeted reinnervation amputees and on analogous sites in able-bodied controls. Grating orientation thresholds for the reinnervated skin of the targeted reinnervation amputees were found to be similar to normal ranges for both the amputees' contralateral skin and also for the control population. Point localization thresholds for these amputees were found to be lower for their reinnervated skin than for their contralateral skin. Reinnervated point localization thresholds values were also lower in comparison to homologous chest sites on the control population. Mechanisms appear to be in place to maximize re-established touch input in targeted reinnervation amputees. It seems that sound sensory function is provided to the denervated skin of the residual limb when connected to afferent pathways once serving highly functionally relevant regions of the brain. This suggests that tactile interface devices could be used to give a physiologically appropriate sense of touch to a prosthetic limb, which would likely help with better functional utilization of the prosthetic device and possibly help to more effectively integrate the device with the user's self-image."

This paper describes in detail the general concept for WOTAS, outlining the special features of the design and selection of system components. Two control strategies developed for tremor suppression with exoskeletons are described. These two strategies are based on biomechanical loading and notch filtering the tremor through the application of internal forces. Results from experiments using these two strategies on patients with tremor are summarized. Finally, results from clinical trials are presented, which indicate the feasibility of ambulatory mechanical suppression of tremor."

We attempted to address this issue by designing a myoelectric control system to modulate prosthetic hand posture and digit force distribution.\nMethods: We recorded surface electromyographic (EMG) signals from five forearm muscles in eight able-bodied subjects while they modulated hand posture and the flexion force distribution of individual fingers. We used a support vector machine (SVM) and a random forest regression (RFR) to map EMG signal features to hand posture and individual digit forces, respectively. After training, subjects performed grasping tasks and hand gestures while a computer program computed and displayed online feedback of all digit forces, in which digits were flexed, and the magnitude of contact forces. We also used a commercially available prosthetic hand, the i-Limb (Touch Bionics), to provide a practical demonstration of the proposed approach's ability to control hand posture and finger forces.\nResults: Subjects could control hand pose and force distribution across the fingers during online testing. Decoding success rates ranged from 60% (index finger pointing) to 83-99% for 2-digit grasp and resting state, respectively. Subjects could also modulate finger force distribution.\nDiscussion: This work provides a proof of concept for the application of SVM and RFR for online control of hand posture and finger force distribution, respectively. Our approach has potential applications for enabling in-hand manipulation with a prosthetic hand."

DEKA used feedback from the VA optimization study and from their own subjects to refine the gen 2 prototype. Thirty-three unique subjects participated in the VA evaluation; 26 participated in the gen 2 evaluation (1 subject participated twice), 13 participated in the gen 3 evaluation, and 5 participated in both gen 2 and gen 3 evaluations. Subject data were gathered through structured and open-ended surveys, interviews, and audio- and videotaped sessions.

Eleven categories of feedback were identified: weight, cosmesis, hand grips, wrist design, elbow design, end-point control, foot controls, batteries and chargers, visual notifications, tactor, and socket features. Final feedback on the gen 3 was generally positive, particularly regarding improvements in wrist design, visual notifications, foot controls, end-point control, and cosmesis. Additional refinements to make the device lighter in weight, eliminate external wires and cables, and eliminate the external battery may further enhance its perceived usability and acceptability."

    "title": "Long-Term Home-Use of Sensory-Motor-Integrated Bidirectional Bionic Prosthetic Arms Promotes Functional, Perceptual, and Cognitive Changes",
    "abstract": "Cutaneous sensation is vital to controlling our hands and upper limbs. It helps close the motor control loop by informing adjustments of grasping forces during object manipulations and provides much of the information the brain requires to perceive our limbs as a part of our bodies. This sensory information is absent to upper-limb prosthesis users. Although robotic prostheses are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the absence of feedback imposes a reliance on open-loop control and limits the functional potential as an integrated part of the body. Experimental systems to restore physiologically relevant sensory information to prosthesis users are beginning to emerge. However, the impact of their long-term use on functional abilities, body image, and neural adaptation processes remains unclear. Understanding these effects is essential to transition sensate prostheses from sophisticated assistive tools to integrated replacement limbs. We recruited three participants with high-level upper-limb amputation who previously received targeted reinnervation surgery. Each participant was fit with a neural-machine-interface prosthesis that allowed participants to operate their device by thinking about moving their missing limb. Additionally, we fit a sensory feedback system that allowed participants to experience touch to the prosthesis as touch on their missing limb. All three participants performed a long-term take-home trial. Two participants used their neural-machine-interface systems with touch feedback and one control participant used his prescribed, insensate prosthesis. A series of functional outcome metrics and psychophysical evaluations were performed using sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses before and after the take-home period to capture changes in functional abilities, limb embodiment, and neural adaptation. Our results demonstrated that the relationship between users and sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses is dynamic and changes with long-term use. The presence of touch sensation had a near-immediate impact on how the users operated their prostheses. In the multiple independent measures of users' functional abilities employed, we observed a spectrum of performance changes following long-term use. Furthermore, after the take-home period, participants more appropriately integrated their prostheses into their body images and psychophysical tests provided strong evidence that neural and cortical adaptation occurred."

    "title": "Sensory feedback in a myoelectric upper limb prosthesis: a preliminary report",
    "abstract": "Upper limb prostheses are often rejected because they do not provide the sensory feedback available from a normal hand. A system for providing sensory feedback has been developed at the University of New Brunswick for use with the three-state myoelectric controls prepared in the Bioengineering Institute there. Strain gauges mounted on the forefinger of an electric hand provide information which is processed electronically to cause a tingling sensation in the patient's stump, proportional in its intensity to the pinch force in the finger. This system has been used by a patient at the Ontario Crippled Children's Centre in Toronto, since June 1976. She uses it consistently with great satisfaction and enthusiasm. It gives her a sense of competence and confidence she does not have without it."

    "title": "Repeated Exposure to Forward Support-Surface Perturbation During Overground Walking Alters Upper-Body Kinematics and Step Parameters",
    "abstract": "Locomotion requires both proactive and reactive control strategies to maintain balance. The current study aimed to: (i) ascertain upper body postural responses following first exposure to a forward (slip) support-surface perturbation; (ii) investigate effects of repeated perturbation exposure; (iii) establish relationships between arms and other response components (trunk; center of mass control). Young adults (N = 11) completed 14 walking trials on a robotic platform; six elicited a slip response. Kinematic analyses were focused on extrapolated center of mass position (xCoM), bilateral upper- and forearm elevation velocity, trunk angular velocity, and step parameters. Results demonstrated that postural responses evoked in the first slip exposure were the largest in magnitude (e.g., reduced backward stability, altered reactive stepping, etc.) and preceded by anticipatory anterior adjustments of xCoM. In relation to the perturbed leg, the large contra- and ipsilateral arm responses observed (in first exposure) were characteristically asymmetric and scaled to the degree of peak trunk extension. With repeated exposure, xCoM anticipatory adjustments were altered and in turn, reduced posterior xCoM motion occurred following a slip (changes plateaued at second exposure). The few components of the slip response that persisted across multiple exposures did so at a lesser magnitude (e.g., step length and arms)."

The aim of the study was to test whether additional sensorimotor training of paralyzed or paretic upper limbs, delivered by NeReBot, enhanced motor and functional outcome in stroke patients.\nMethods: Twenty patients with post-stroke hemiparesis or hemiplegia received standard poststroke multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and were randomly assigned either to exposure to the robotic device without training or to additional sensorimotor robotic training (about 4 h/week) for 4 weeks. Robot training consisted of peripheral manipulation of the shoulder and elbow of the impaired limb, correlated with visual stimuli.\nResults: At hospital discharge, impairment and disability had declined in all patients, but the group with robot training showed higher gains on motor impairment and functional recovery, which were maintained at the 3-month follow-up. No adverse events resulted from robot-assisted therapy.\nConclusions: According to our results, NeReBot therapy may efficaciously complement standard post-stroke multidisciplinary rehabilitation and offer novel therapeutic strategies for neurological rehabilitation."

    "title": "Multimodal BCI-mediated FES suppression of pathological tremor",
    "abstract": "Tremor constitutes the most common movement disorder; in fact 14.5% of population between 50 to 89 years old suffers from it. Moreover, 65% of patients with upper limb tremor report disability when performing their activities of daily living (ADL). Unfortunately, 25% of patients do not respond to drugs or neurosurgery. In this regard, TREMOR project proposes functional compensation of upper limb tremors with a soft wearable robot that applies biomechanical loads through functional electrical stimulation (FES) of muscles. This wearable robot is driven by a Brain Neural Computer Interface (BNCI). This paper presents a multimodal BCI to assess generation, transmission and execution of both volitional and tremorous movements based on electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG) and inertial sensors (IMUs). These signals are combined to obtain: 1) the intention to perform a voluntary movement from cortical activity (EEG), 2) tremor onset, and an estimation of tremor frequency from muscle activation (EMG), and 3) instantaneous tremor amplitude and frequency from kinematic measurements (IMUs). Integration of this information will provide control signals to drive the FES-based wearable robot."

    "title": "Prosthetic arm monitoring system using a programmable interface controller",
    "abstract": "Children with upper extremity limb deficiency are often prescribed a prosthetic arm to assist with daily function. Three types of prostheses are available: passive, active body-powered, and active myoelectric; costs range from $3,000 to $15,000. Clinicians rely on parent and child feedback regarding the usefulness of the prosthesis, and may assess the child's skill in using the device in a controlled setting. However, these methods do not provide an objective quantification of the wear and use of the device during daily activities. The purpose of this project is to develop a sensor to record the amount of time per day the prosthetic arm is worn, and to count the number of times per day the child activates (closes) the prosthetic hand (or terminal device). The system that has been developed can be integrated unobtrusively into a child's prosthetic arm. A programmable interface controller (PIC) with interface circuitry and memory was developed to record the daily wear pattern and hand usage of the prosthesis at 15-minute intervals. Memory and battery capacities are sufficient to record data over a three-month period. A personal computer interface downloads the collected data and may be used to reprogram the device for different time periods of data collection. All components, including the battery, have a mass of 87 grams and fit inside the forearm cavity of a 9-year old's prosthesis. Controlled trials are underway at Shriners Hospital for Children, Northern California, to determine system reliability."

    "title": "Broadband Prosthetic Interfaces: Combining Nerve Transfers and Implantable Multichannel EMG Technology to Decode Spinal Motor Neuron Activity",
    "abstract": "Modern robotic hands/upper limbs may replace multiple degrees of freedom of extremity function. However, their intuitive use requires a high number of control signals, which current man-machine interfaces do not provide. Here, we discuss a broadband control interface that combines targeted muscle reinnervation, implantable multichannel electromyographic sensors, and advanced decoding to address the increasing capabilities of modern robotic limbs. With targeted muscle reinnervation, nerves that have lost their targets due to an amputation are surgically transferred to residual stump muscles to increase the number of intuitive prosthetic control signals. This surgery re-establishes a nerve-muscle connection that is used for sensing nerve activity with myoelectric interfaces. Moreover, the nerve transfer determines neurophysiological effects, such as muscular hyper-reinnervation and cortical reafferentation that can be exploited by the myoelectric interface. Modern implantable multichannel EMG sensors provide signals from which it is possible to disentangle the behavior of single motor neurons. Recent studies have shown that the neural drive to muscles can be decoded from these signals and thereby the user's intention can be reliably estimated. By combining these concepts in chronic implants and embedded electronics, we believe that it is in principle possible to establish a broadband man-machine interface, with specific applications in prosthesis control. This perspective illustrates this concept, based on combining advanced surgical techniques with recording hardware and processing algorithms. Here we describe the scientific evidence for this concept, current state of investigations, challenges, and alternative approaches to improve current prosthetic interfaces."

    "title": "Assessment of brain-machine interfaces from the perspective of people with paralysis",
    "abstract": "Objective: One of the main goals of brain-machine interface (BMI) research is to restore function to people with paralysis. Currently, multiple BMI design features are being investigated, based on various input modalities (externally applied and surgically implantable sensors) and output modalities (e.g. control of computer systems, prosthetic arms, and functional electrical stimulation systems). While these technologies may eventually provide some level of benefit, they each carry associated burdens for end-users. We sought to assess the attitudes of people with paralysis toward using various technologies to achieve particular benefits, given the burdens currently associated with the use of each system.\nApproach: We designed and distributed a technology survey to determine the level of benefit necessary for people with tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury to consider using different technologies, given the burdens currently associated with them. The survey queried user preferences for 8 BMI technologies including electroencephalography, electrocorticography, and intracortical microelectrode arrays, as well as a commercially available eye tracking system for comparison. Participants used a 5-point scale to rate their likelihood to adopt these technologies for 13 potential control capabilities.\nMain results: Survey respondents were most likely to adopt BMI technology to restore some of their natural upper extremity function, including restoration of hand grasp and/or some degree of natural arm movement. High speed typing and control of a fast robot arm were also of interest to this population. Surgically implanted wireless technologies were twice as 'likely' to be adopted as their wired equivalents.\nSignificance: Assessing end-user preferences is an essential prerequisite to the design and implementation of any assistive technology. The results of this survey suggest that people with tetraplegia would adopt an unobtrusive, autonomous BMI system for both restoration of upper extremity function and control of external devices such as communication interfaces."

    "abstract": "As a contribution toward the goal of adaptable, intelligent artificial limbs, this work introduces a continuous actor-critic reinforcement learning method for optimizing the control of multi-function myoelectric devices. Using a simulated upper-arm robotic prosthesis, we demonstrate how it is possible to derive successful limb controllers from myoelectric data using only a sparse human-delivered training signal, without requiring detailed knowledge about the task domain. This reinforcement-based machine learning framework is well suited for use by both patients and clinical staff, and may be easily adapted to different application domains and the needs of individual amputees. To our knowledge, this is the first my-oelectric control approach that facilitates the online learning of new amputee-specific motions based only on a one-dimensional (scalar) feedback signal provided by the user of the prosthesis."

    "abstract": "Transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) are polyimide-based microelectrodes, which are potentially very interesting to restore sensorimotor functions in disabled people. By means of microstimulation of the nerve stump of an amputee, it can be possible to manipulate the phantom limb sensation, to provide sensory feedback to upper limb amputees, and to investigate methods of treatment of phantom limb pain. The current insertion procedure of TIMEs is completely done by hand. This makes the task difficult. This paper presents the preliminary results related to the development of a robotic tool to increase the accuracy in electrode placement and reduced size of the working area. The possibility to manage insertion parameters such as force, velocity, and positioning, could decrease the risk of damaging the nervous tissue, improving the coordination, and making placements repeatable. With the aim of solving the issues avbove, we developed a first prototype of a 4DoF multi-axis device. Additional strategies concerning system components and control are discussed. We performed characterization of implantation mechanics to derive mechanical design specifications for the robotic device. Force caracterization of the pig peripheral nerve during penetration of the needle at three velocities (1, 30, 40mm/sec) was executed. Results shown inverse relationship between maximal force and velocities values. The force values extracted varied between 0.081-0.174 N."

    "title": "Mechanotactile Sensory Feedback Improves Embodiment of a Prosthetic Hand During Active Use",
    "abstract": "There have been several advancements in the field of myoelectric prostheses to improve dexterity and restore hand grasp patterns for persons with upper limb loss, including robust control strategies, novel sensory feedback, and multifunction prosthetic terminal devices. Although these advancements have shown to improve prosthesis performance, a key element that may further improve acceptance is often overlooked. Embodiment, which encompasses the feeling of owning, controlling and locating the device without the need to constantly look at it, has been shown to be affected by sensory feedback. However, the specific aspects of embodiment that are influenced are not clearly understood, particularly when a prosthesis is actively controlled. In this work, we used a sensorized simulated prosthesis in able-bodied participants to investigate the contribution of sensory feedback, active motor control, and the combination of both to the components of embodiment; using a common methodology in the literature, namely the rubber hand illusion (RHI). Our results indicate that (1) the sensorized simulated prosthesis may be embodied by able-bodied users in a similar fashion as prosthetic devices embodied by persons with upper limb amputation, and (2) mechanotactile sensory feedback might not only be useful for improving certain aspects of embodiment, i.e., ownership and location, but also may have a modulating effect on other aspects, namely sense of agency, when provided asynchronously during active motor control tasks. This work may allow us to further investigate and manipulate factors contributing to the complex phenomenon of embodiment in relation to active motor control of a device, enabling future study of more precise quantitative measures of embodiment that do not rely as much on subjective perception."

    "abstract": "Robotic systems currently used in upper-limb rehabilitation following stroke rely on some form of visual feedback as part of the intervention program. We evaluated the effect of a video game environment (air hockey) on reaching in stroke with various levels of arm support. We used the Arm Coordination Training 3D system to provide variable arm support and to control the hockey stick. We instructed seven subjects to reach to one of three targets covering the workspace of the impaired arm during the reaching task and to reach as far as possible while playing the video game. The results from this study showed that across subjects, support levels, and targets, the reaching distances achieved with the reaching task were greater than those covered with the video game. This held even after further restricting the mapped workspace of the arm to the area most affected by the flexion synergy (effectively forcing subjects to fight the synergy to reach the hockey puck). The results from this study highlight the importance of designing video games that include specific reaching targets in the workspace compromised by the expression of the flexion synergy. Such video games would also adapt the target location online as a subject's success rate increases."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), delivered to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1), appears to enhance the brain's response to rehabilitative training in patients with stroke. However, its clinical utility is highly subject to variability in different protocols. New evidence has reported that preceding iTBS, with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) may stabilise and even boost the facilitatory effect of iTBS on the stimulated M1, via metaplasticity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of iTBS primed with cTBS (ie, priming iTBS), in addition to robot-assisted training (RAT), on the improvement of the hemiparetic upper limb functions of stroke patients and to explore potential sensorimotor neuroplasticity using electroencephalography (EEG).\nMethods and analysis: A three-arm, subjects and assessors-blinded, randomised controlled trial will be performed with patients with chronic stroke. An estimated sample of 36 patients will be needed based on the prior sample size calculation. All participants will be randomly allocated to receive 10 sessions of rTMS with different TBS protocols (cTBS+iTBS, sham cTBS+iTBS and sham cTBS+sham iTBS), three to five sessions per week, for 2-3 weeks. All participants will receive 60 min of RAT after each stimulation session. Primary outcomes will be assessed using Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores and Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using kinematic outcomes generated during RAT and EEG.\nEthics and dissemination: Ethical approval has been obtained from The Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee, University Research Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (reference number: HSEARS20190718003).

    "abstract": "The structural design, control system, and integrated biofeedback for a wearable exoskeletal robot for upper extremity stroke rehabilitation are presented. Assisted with clinical evaluation, designers, engineers, and scientists have built a device for robotic assisted upper extremity repetitive therapy (RUPERT). Intense, repetitive physical rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial overcoming upper extremity deficits, but the therapy is labor intensive and expensive and difficult to evaluate quantitatively and objectively. The RUPERT is developed to provide a low cost, safe and easy-to-use, robotic-device to assist the patient and therapist to achieve more systematic therapy at home or in the clinic. The RUPERT has four actuated degrees-of-freedom driven by compliant and safe pneumatic muscles (PMs) on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. They are programmed to actuate the device to extend the arm and move the arm in 3-D space. It is very important to note that gravity is not compensated and the daily tasks are practiced in a natural setting. Because the device is wearable and lightweight to increase portability, it can be worn standing or sitting providing therapy tasks that better mimic activities of daily living. The sensors feed back position and force information for quantitative evaluation of task performance. The device can also provide real-time, objective assessment of functional improvement. We have tested the device on stroke survivors performing two critical activities of daily living (ADL): reaching out and self feeding. The future improvement of the device involves increased degrees-of-freedom and interactive control to adapt to a user's physical conditions."

    "abstract": "Stroke patients with severe motor deficits cannot execute task-oriented rehabilitation exercises with their affected upper extremity. Advanced rehabilitation technology may support them in performing such reach-to-grasp movements. The challenge is, however, to provide assistance as needed, while maintaining the participants' commitment during the exercises. In this feasibility study, we introduced a closed-loop neuroprosthesis for reach-to-grasp assistance which combines adaptive multi-channel neuromuscular stimulation with a multi-joint arm exoskeleton. Eighteen severely affected chronic stroke patients were assisted by a gravity-compensating, seven-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton which was attached to the paretic arm for performing reach-to-grasp exercises resembling activities of daily living in a virtual environment. During the exercises, adaptive electrical stimulation was applied to seven different muscles of the upper extremity in a performance-dependent way to enhance the task-oriented movement trajectory. The stimulation intensity was individualized for each targeted muscle and remained subthreshold, i.e., induced no overt support. Closed-loop neuromuscular stimulation could be well integrated into the exoskeleton-based training, and increased the task-related range of motion (p = 0.0004) and movement velocity (p = 0.015), while preserving accuracy. The highest relative stimulation intensity was required to facilitate the grasping function. The facilitated range of motion correlated with the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment score of the patients (p = 0.028). Combining adaptive multi-channel neuromuscular stimulation with antigravity assistance amplifies the residual motor capabilities of severely affected stroke patients during rehabilitation exercises and may thus provide a customized training environment for patient-tailored support while preserving the participants' engagement."

This paper presents a subject centered approach method that includes the human into the loop by using physiological feedback techniques. This allows the robot to adapt to several different patients and maintain the therapy as intensive as possible without compromising patients health or letting the individual get stressed which would result in a decay of the overall performance."

    "abstract": "Chronic wrist impairment is frequent following stroke and negatively impacts everyday life. Rehabilitation of the dysfunctional limb is possible but requires extensive training and motivation. Wearable training devices might offer new opportunities for rehabilitation. However, few devices are available to train wrist extension even though this movement is highly relevant for many upper limb activities of daily living. As a proof of concept, we developed the eWrist, a wearable one degree-of-freedom powered exoskeleton which supports wrist extension training. Conceptually one might think of an electric bike which provides mechanical support only when the rider moves the pedals, i.e. it enhances motor activity but does not replace it. Stroke patients may not have the ability to produce overt movements, but they might still be able to produce weak muscle activation that can be measured via surface electromyography (sEMG). By combining force and sEMG-based control in an assist-as-needed support strategy, we aim at providing a training device which enhances activity of the wrist extensor muscles in the context of daily life activities, thereby, driving cortical reorganization and recovery. Preliminary results show that the integration of sEMG signals in the control strategy allow for adjustable assistance with respect to a proxy measurement of corticomotor drive."

    "abstract": "With stroke survivors (n=30) as the test population, we investigated how upper extremity training with negative viscosity affects coordination in unassisted conditions. Using a planar force-feedback device, subjects performed exploratory movements within an environment that simulated 1) negative viscosity added to elbow and shoulder joints 2) augmented inertia to the upper and lower arm combined with negative viscosity, or 3) a null force field (control). After training, we evaluated each subject's ability to perform circular movements in the null field. Negative viscosity training resulted in greater within-day reductions in error compared with the combined field training. Negative viscosity promoted greater distributions of accelerations during free exploration, especially in the sagittal axis, while combined field training diminished overall activity. Both force field training groups exhibited next day retention, while this was not observed for the control group. The improvement in performance suggests that greater range of kinematic experiences contribute to learning, even despite novel force field environments. These findings provide support for the use of movement amplifying environments for upper extremity rehabilitation, allowing greater access to training while maintaining user engagement."

However, additional treatments are sometime required to prolong the effects of the toxin, compensate for its progressive loss of efficacy in some subjects, and re-educate handwriting (e.g., rehabilitation strategies). Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been employed to improve W'sC, but with short-lasting and controversial outcomes. We report on the effects of a long-lasting low-frequency rTMS paradigm on W'sC symptoms. A 25-year-old male with a diagnosis of simple W'sC was enrolled in the study. He underwent an objective assessment using the Writer's Cramp Rating Scale (WCRS) and the 1-min writing test. Further, we recorded muscle activation of the upper limb during handwriting using an EMG wireless system. The patient was provided with 1,200 biphasic magnetic pulses delivered at 1 Hz over the left premotor cortex (PMC), 15 times scheduled every 2 days, thus covering a period of 5 weeks, followed by 10 days of rest. This block of stimulations was practiced other four times, for a period of 6 months. The patient showed a gradual clinical improvement with the progression of the treatments. W'sC symptoms totally disappeared and all the clinical scores showed a significant improvement after rTMS completion. Such improvement lasted up to 1 year after the end of the treatment. Moreover, we detected a long-lasting improvement in sensorimotor plasticity as measured by a paired associative stimulation protocol. Our case suggests that the long-lasting application of 1 Hz rTMS to PMC is a safe and potentially valuable tool to improve W'sC symptoms enduringly, probably by reverting maladaptive plasticity mechanisms within the sensory-motor areas of the hemisphere contralateral to the dystonic hand."

    "abstract": "To achieve significant improvement in the function of electric-powered, upper-limb prostheses, we believe it is necessary to develop better control interfaces with inherent sensory feedback. Small cineplasties, or other surgical procedures that also externalize the force and excursion of a muscle, could potentially provide this superior control. Connecting a muscle to a prosthetic component via a controller that embodies the concept of extended physiological proprioception (EPP) would enable the physiological sensory feedback inherent in the skin, muscle, and other tissues of the cineplasty to inform the user of the state of the prosthesis. Multiple miniature forearm tunnel cineplasties, each with an EPP controller, might enable meaningful independent multifinger control of hand prostheses. At higher levels of amputation (e.g., transhumeral), small pectoral or deltoid cineplasties could augment existing control sources to improve control of multifunctional total arm prostheses. To explore the feasibility of these ideas, we quantified the control capabilities of individuals with preexisting biceps muscle tunnel cineplasties with the use of pursuit tracking experiments. A \"proof-of-concept\" EPP electric hand prosthesis was also successfully developed for a subject with agonist-antagonist, forearm tendon exteriorization cineplasties. The results of the tracking studies demonstrate numerically the efficacy of control by cineplastized muscles relative to other control approaches."

Our goal was to develop a short set of tasks that would be representative of a much larger set of activities of daily living (ADLs), while also being feasible for a user of a unilateral, implanted functional electrical stimulation (FES) system. To compile this list of tasks, we reviewed existing clinical outcome measures related to arm and hand function and were further informed by surveys of patient desires. We ultimately selected a set of five tasks that captured the most common components of movement seen in ADLs and is therefore highly relevant for assessing FES-restored unilateral arm function in individuals with high cervical spinal cord injury. The tasks are intended to be used when setting design specifications and for evaluating and standardizing rehabilitation technologies under development. While not unique, this set of tasks will provide a common basis for comparing different interventions (e.g., FES, powered orthoses, robotic assistants) and testing different user command interfaces (e.g., sip-and-puff, head joysticks, brain-computer interfaces)."

    "title": "A realistic implementation of ultrasound imaging as a human-machine interface for upper-limb amputees",
    "abstract": "In the past years, especially with the advent of multi-fingered hand prostheses, the rehabilitation robotics community has tried to improve the use of human-machine interfaces to reliably control mechanical artifacts with many degrees of freedom. Ideally, the control schema should be intuitive and reliable, and the calibration (training) short and flexible. This work focuses on medical ultrasound imaging as such an interface. Medical ultrasound imaging is rich in information, fast, widespread, relatively cheap and provides high temporal/spatial resolution; moreover, it is harmless. We already showed that a linear relationship exists between ultrasound image features of the human forearm and the hand kinematic configuration; here we demonstrate that such a relationship also exists between similar features and fingertip forces. An experiment with 10 participants shows that a very fast data collection, namely of zero and maximum forces only and using no force sensors, suffices to train a system that predicts intermediate force values spanning a range of about 20 N per finger with average errors in the range 10-15%. This training approach, in which the ground truth is limited to an \"on-off\" visual stimulus, constitutes a realistic scenario and we claim that it could be equally used by intact subjects and amputees. The linearity of the relationship between images and forces is furthermore exploited to build an incremental learning system that works online and can be retrained on demand by the human subject. We expect this system to be able in principle to reconstruct an amputee's imaginary limb, and act as a sensible improvement of, e.g., mirror therapy, in the treatment of phantom-limb pain."

    "title": "Haptic Error Modulation Outperforms Visual Error Amplification When Learning a Modified Gait Pattern",
    "abstract": "Robotic algorithms that augment movement errors have been proposed as promising training strategies to enhance motor learning and neurorehabilitation. However, most research effort has focused on rehabilitation of upper limbs, probably because large movement errors are especially dangerous during gait training, as they might result in stumbling and falling. Furthermore, systematic large movement errors might limit the participants' motivation during training. In this study, we investigated the effect of training with novel error modulating strategies, which guarantee a safe training environment, on motivation and learning of a modified asymmetric gait pattern. Thirty healthy young participants walked in the exoskeletal robotic system Lokomat while performing a foot target-tracking task, which required an increased hip and knee flexion in the dominant leg. Learning the asymmetric gait pattern with three different strategies was evaluated: (i) No disturbance: no robot disturbance/guidance was applied, (ii) haptic error amplification: unsafe and discouraging large errors were limited with haptic guidance, while haptic error amplification enhanced awareness of small errors relevant for learning, and (iii) visual error amplification: visually observed errors were amplified in a virtual reality environment. We also evaluated whether increasing the movement variability during training by adding randomly varying haptic disturbances on top of the other training strategies further enhances learning. We analyzed participants' motor performance and self-reported intrinsic motivation before, during and after training. We found that training with the novel haptic error amplification strategy did not hamper motor adaptation and enhanced transfer of the practiced asymmetric gait pattern to free walking. Training with visual error amplification, on the other hand, increased errors during training and hampered motor learning. Participants who trained with visual error amplification also reported a reduced perceived competence. Adding haptic disturbance increased the movement variability during training, but did not have a significant effect on motor adaptation, probably because training with haptic disturbance on top of visual and haptic error amplification decreased the participants' feelings of competence. The proposed novel haptic error modulating controller that amplifies small task-relevant errors while limiting large errors outperformed visual error augmentation and might provide a promising framework to improve robotic gait training outcomes in neurological patients."

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic surgeons perform precise and time consuming procedures while holding awkward poses in their upper body and arms. There is an ongoing effort to produce robotic tools for laparoscopic surgery that will simplify these tasks and reduce risk of errors to help both the surgeon and the patient. STIFF-FLOP is an ongoing EU FP7 project focusing on this by creating a stiffness controllable soft robotic manipulator. This paper reports on a study to test the soft manipulator's learnability and the effort associated with its use. The tests involved a limited prototype of the manipulator with a custom built test rig and EMG acquisition system. Task times and video recordings along with EMG waveforms from the forearm muscles of participants (n=25) were measured for objective assessment. A questionnaire was also provided to the participants for subjective assessment. The data shows that in average EMG levels were 25.9% less in RMS when using the STIFF-FLOP arm than when conventional laparoscopic tools were used. In terms of learnability, from the first to the second attempt on the STIFF-FLOP manipulator, elapsed time was reduced by an average of 32.1%. Further details and analysis of the EMG signals as well as time and questionnaire results is presented in the paper."

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of a second-generation implantable neuroprosthesis that provides improved control of hand grasp and elbow extension for individuals with cervical level spinal cord injury. The key feature of this system is that users control their stimulated function through electromyographic (EMG) signals.\nMethods: The second-generation neuroprosthesis consists of 12 stimulating electrodes, 2 EMG signal recording electrodes, an implanted stimulator-telemeter device, an external control unit, and a transmit/receive coil. The system was implanted in a single surgical procedure. Functional outcomes for each subject were evaluated in the domains of body functions and structures, activity performance, and societal participation.\nResults: Three individuals with C5/C6 spinal cord injury received system implantation with subsequent prospective evaluation for a minimum of 2 years. All 3 subjects demonstrated that EMG signals can be recorded from voluntary muscles in the presence of electrical stimulation of nearby muscles. Significantly increased pinch force and grasp function was achieved for each subject. Functional evaluation demonstrated improvement in at least 5 activities of daily living using the Activities of Daily Living Abilities Test. Each subject was able to use the device at home. There were no system failures. Two of 6 EMG electrodes required surgical revision because of suboptimal location of the recording electrodes.\nConclusions: These results indicate that a neuroprosthesis with implanted myoelectric control is an effective method for restoring hand function in midcervical level spinal cord injury."

    "abstract": "Purposes: To evaluate the feasibility of using the single-joint Hybrid Assistive Limb® robot (HAL) to assist with shoulder flexion-extension in healthy adults, and to assess the capacity of the HAL to analyze the bioelectrical signals of muscle activity for shoulder flexion-extension.\nMethods: This cross-sectional feasibility study included six healthy adult men with no impairment in shoulder motion. The single-joint HAL was fixed to a custom-designed platform and upper arm attachment, and aligned 3 cm below the acromion process. Vital signs, shoulder fatigue, and shoulder pain were evaluated before and after the shoulder elevation exercise performed with and without the HAL. Activity of selected muscles of the shoulder was recorded using a wireless superficial electromyography device. Shoulder movement was captured using a three-dimensional motion analysis system.\nResults: The HAL supported smooth flexion-extension of the arm at the shoulder joint, with no negative effects on vital signs, shoulder fatigue, and shoulder pain. The HAL decreased muscle activity levels, with a 55% decrease in trapezius muscle activity. The upward rotation angle of the scapula was significantly lower with the HAL at 120° of shoulder flexion.\nConclusion: The single-joint HAL provided safe and effective assistance to scapular plane shoulder flexion-extension among healthy adults."

    "title": "Robust tactile sensory responses in finger area of primate motor cortex relevant to prosthetic control",
    "abstract": "Objective: Challenges in improving the performance of dexterous upper-limb brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have prompted renewed interest in quantifying the amount and type of sensory information naturally encoded in the primary motor cortex (M1). Previous single unit studies in monkeys showed M1 is responsive to tactile stimulation, as well as passive and active movement of the limbs. However, recent work in this area has focused primarily on proprioception. Here we examined instead how tactile somatosensation of the hand and fingers is represented in M1.\nApproach: We recorded multi- and single units and thresholded neural activity from macaque M1 while gently brushing individual finger pads at 2 Hz. We also recorded broadband neural activity from electrocorticogram (ECoG) grids placed on human motor cortex, while applying the same tactile stimulus.\nMain results: Units displaying significant differences in firing rates between individual fingers (p < 0.05) represented up to 76.7% of sorted multiunits across four monkeys. After normalizing by the number of channels with significant motor finger responses, the percentage of electrodes with significant tactile responses was 74.9% ± 24.7%. No somatotopic organization of finger preference was obvious across cortex, but many units exhibited cosine-like tuning across multiple digits. Sufficient sensory information was present in M1 to correctly decode stimulus position from multiunit activity above chance levels in all monkeys, and also from ECoG gamma power in two human subjects.\nSignificance: These results provide some explanation for difficulties experienced by motor decoders in clinical trials of cortically controlled prosthetic hands, as well as the general problem of disentangling motor and sensory signals in primate motor cortex during dextrous tasks. Additionally, examination of unit tuning during tactile and proprioceptive inputs indicates cells are often tuned differently in different contexts, reinforcing the need for continued refinement of BMI training and decoding approaches to closed-loop BMI systems for dexterous grasping."

    "title": "Probability-based prediction of activity in multiple arm muscles: implications for functional electrical stimulation",
    "abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) involves artificial activation of muscles with implanted electrodes to restore motor function in paralyzed individuals. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by FES, however, is limited to a small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial difficulty associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To overcome this limitation in controlling FES systems, we used probabilistic methods to estimate the levels of muscle activity in the human arm during a wide range of free movements based on kinematic information of the upper limb. Conditional probability distributions were generated based on hand kinematics and associated surface electromyographic (EMG) signals from 12 arm muscles recorded during a training task involving random movements of the arm in one subject. These distributions were then used to predict in four other subjects the patterns of muscle activity associated with eight different movement tasks. On average, about 40% of the variance in the actual EMG signals could be accounted for in the predicted EMG signals. These results suggest that probabilistic methods ultimately might be used to predict the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to produce a wide array of desired movements in paralyzed individuals with FES."

    "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability around the world. Many survivors experience upper extremity (UE) impairment with few rehabilitation opportunities, secondary to a lack of voluntary muscle control. We developed a novel rehabilitation paradigm (TDS-HM) that uses a Tongue Drive System (TDS) to control a UE robotic device (Hand Mentor: HM) while engaging with an interactive user interface. In this study, six stroke survivors with moderate to severe UE impairment completed 15 two-hour sessions of TDS-HM training over five weeks. Participants were instructed to move their paretic arm, with synchronized tongue commands to track a target waveform while using visual feedback to make accurate movements. Following TDS-HM training, significant improvements in tracking performance translated into improvements in the UE portion of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment, range of motion, and all subscores for the Stroke Impact Scale. Regression modeling found daily training time to be a significant predictor of decreases in tracking error, indicating the presence of a potential dose-response relationship. The results of this pilot study indicate that the TDS-HM system can elicit significant improvements in moderate to severely impaired stroke survivors. This pilot study gives preliminary insight into the volume of treatment time required to improve outcomes."

    "title": "Robot-assisted reaching exercise promotes arm movement recovery in chronic hemiparetic stroke: a randomized controlled pilot study",
    "abstract": "Background and purpose: Providing active assistance to complete desired arm movements is a common technique in upper extremity rehabilitation after stroke. Such active assistance may improve recovery by affecting somatosensory input, motor planning, spasticity or soft tissue properties, but it is labor intensive and has not been validated in controlled trials. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of robotically administered active-assistive exercise and compare those with free reaching voluntary exercise in improving arm movement ability after chronic stroke.\nMethods: Nineteen individuals at least one year post-stroke were randomized into one of two groups. One group performed 24 sessions of active-assistive reaching exercise with a simple robotic device, while a second group performed a task-matched amount of unassisted reaching. The main outcome measures were range and speed of supported arm movement, range, straightness and smoothness of unsupported reaching, and the Rancho Los Amigos Functional Test of Upper Extremity Function.\nResults and discussion: There were significant improvements with training for range of motion and velocity of supported reaching, straightness of unsupported reaching, and functional movement ability. These improvements were not significantly different between the two training groups. The group that performed unassisted reaching exercise improved the smoothness of their reaching movements more than the robot-assisted group.\nConclusion: Improvements with both forms of exercise confirmed that repeated, task-related voluntary activation of the damaged motor system is a key stimulus to motor recovery following chronic stroke. Robotically assisting in reaching successfully improved arm movement ability, although it did not provide any detectable, additional value beyond the movement practice that occurred concurrently with it. The inability to detect any additional value of robot-assisted reaching may have been due to this pilot study's limited sample size, the specific diagnoses of the participants, or the inclusion of only individuals with chronic stroke."

    "title": "Exploring teleimpedance and tactile feedback for intuitive control of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a teleimpedance controller with tactile feedback for more intuitive control of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand. With the aim to realize a robust, efficient and low-cost hand prosthesis design, the SoftHand is developed based on the motor control principle of synergies, through which the immense complexity of the hand is simplified into distinct motor patterns. Due to the built-in flexibility of the hand joints, as the SoftHand grasps, it follows a synergistic path while allowing grasping of objects of various shapes using only a single motor. The DC motor of the hand incorporates a novel teleimpedance control in which the user's postural and stiffness synergy references are tracked in real-time. In addition, for intuitive control of the hand, two tactile interfaces are developed. The first interface (mechanotactile) exploits a disturbance observer which estimates the interaction forces in contact with the grasped object. Estimated interaction forces are then converted and applied to the upper arm of the user via a custom made pressure cuff. The second interface employs vibrotactile feedback based on surface irregularities and acceleration signals and is used to provide the user with information about the surface properties of the object as well as detection of object slippage while grasping. Grasp robustness and intuitiveness of hand control were evaluated in two sets of experiments. Results suggest that incorporating the aforementioned haptic feedback strategies, together with user-driven compliance of the hand, facilitate execution of safe and stable grasps, while suggesting that a low-cost, robust hand employing hardware-based synergies might be a good alternative to traditional myoelectric prostheses."

    "title": "Evoking Apparent Moving Sensation in the Hand via Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation",
    "abstract": "The restoration of sensory feedback in amputees plays a fundamental role in the prosthesis control and in the communication on the afferent channel between hand and brain. The literature shows that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be a promising non-invasive technique to elicit sensory feedback in amputees, especially in the lower limb through the phenomenon of apparent moving sensation (AMS). It consists of delivering a sensation that moves along a specific part of the body. This study proposes to use TENS to elicit tactile sensations and adopt AMS to reproduce moving sensations on the hand, such as those related to an object moving in the hand or slipping upward or downward. To this purpose, the developed experimental protocol consists of two phases: (i) the mapping of the evoked sensations and (ii) the generation of the AMS. In the latter phase, the pulse amplitude variation (PAV), the pulse width variation (PWV), and the interstimulus delay modulation (ISDM) methods were compared. For the comparative analysis, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni correction (P < 0.016) was carried out on the success rate and on the ranking of methods expressed by the subjects. Results from the mapping protocol show that the delivered sensations were mostly described by the subjects as almost natural and superficial tingling. Results from the AMS protocol show that, for each movement direction, the success rate of ISDM method is higher than that of PWV and PAV and significantly higher than that of PAV for the ulnar-median direction. It recreates an AMS in the hand that effectively allows discriminating the type of sensation and distinguishing the movement direction. Moreover, ISDM was ranked by the subjects as the favorite method for recreating a well-defined and comfortable moving sensation only in the median-ulnar direction. For the ranking results, there was not a statistically significant difference among the methods. The experiments confirmed the good potential of recreating an AMS in the hand through TENS. This encourages to push forward this study on amputees and integrate it in the closed-loop control of a prosthetic system, in order to enable full control of grasp stability and prevent the objects from slippage."

    "title": "Estimating the patient's contribution during robot-assisted therapy",
    "abstract": "Robot-assisted therapy has become increasingly common in neurorehabilitation. Sophisticated controllers have been developed for robots to assist and cooperate with the patient. It is difficult for the patient to judge to what extent the robot contributes to the execution of a movement. Therefore, methods to comprehensively quantify the patient's contribution and provide feedback are of key importance. We developed a method comprehensively to estimate the patient's contribution by combining kinematic measures and the motor assistance applied. Inverse dynamic models of the robot and the passive human arm calculate the required torques to move the robot and the arm and build, together with the recorded motor torque, a metric (in percentage) that represents the patient's contribution to the movement. To evaluate the developed metric, 12 nondisabled subjects and 7 patients with neurological problems simulated instructed movement contributions. The results are compared with a common performance metric. The estimation shows very satisfying results for both groups, even though the arm model used was strongly simplified. Displaying this metric to patients during therapy can potentially motivate them to actively participate in the training."

    "title": "Spatial correlation of high density EMG signals provides features robust to electrode number and shift in pattern recognition for myocontrol",
    "abstract": "Research on pattern recognition for myoelectric control has usually focused on a small number of electromyography (EMG) channels because of better clinical acceptability and low computational load with respect to multi-channel EMG. However, recently, high density (HD) EMG technology has substantially improved, also in practical usability, and can thus be applied in myocontrol. HD EMG provides several closely spaced recordings in multiple locations over the skin surface. This study considered the use of HD EMG for controlling upper limb prostheses, based on pattern recognition. In general, robustness and reliability of classical pattern recognition systems are influenced by electrode shift in dons and doff, and by the presence of malfunctioning channels. The aim of this study is to propose a new approach to attenuate these issues. The HD EMG grid of electrodes is an ensemble of sensors that records data spatially correlated. The experimental variogram, which is a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, was used as feature for classification, contrary to previous approaches that are based on temporal or frequency features. The classification based on the variogram was tested on seven able-bodied subjects and one subject with amputation, for the classification of nine and seven classes, respectively. The performance of the proposed approach was comparable with the classic methods based on time-domain and autoregressive features (average classification accuracy over all methods ∼ 95% for nine classes). However, the new spatial features demonstrated lower sensitivity to electrode shift ( ± 1 cm) with respect to the classic features . When even just one channel was noisy, the classification accuracy dropped by ∼ 10% for all methods. However, the new method could be applied without any retraining to a subset of high-quality channels whereas the classic methods require retraining when some channels are omitted. In conclusion, the new spatial feature space proposed in this study improved the robustness to electrode number and shift in myocontrol with respect to previous approaches."

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to validate the suitability of a novel rotational hydroelastic actuator (rHEA) for use in our new rehabilitation exoskeleton for the upper limbs, the Limpact. The rHEA consists of a rotational hydraulic actuator and a custom-designed symmetric torsion spring in a series-elastic configuration. For rehabilitation therapy and impairment quantification, both compliant impedance control and stiff admittance control modes are possible. In the validation experiments, the torque bandwidth of the rHEA was limited to 18 Hz for a desired 20 N m reference signal (multisine, constant spectrum) due the transport delays in the long flexible tubes between the valve and cylinder. These transport delays also required changes to existing theoretical models to better fit the models on the measured frequency response functions. The (theoretical) measurable torque resolution was better than 0.01 N m and the (validated) delivered torque resolution below 1 N m. After the validation experiments, further iterative improvements resulted in a spring design capable of a maximum output torque of 50 N m with an intrinsic stiffness of 150 N . m/rad and a slightly higher bandwidth. With the design locked, the maximum measurable isometric torque is 100 N m. In conclusion, the rHEA is suitable for upper limb rehabilitation therapy as it matches the desired performance."

However, the precise estimation of the continuous motion of each joint represents a major challenge. In the current study, we present a method for estimating continuous elbow joint movement.\nMethods: We developed a novel approach for estimating the elbow joint angle based on human physiological structure. We used surface electromyography signals to analyze the biomechanical properties of the muscle and combined it with physiological structure to achieve a model for estimating continuous motion. And a genetic algorithm was used to optimize unknown parameters.\nResults: We performed extensive trials to verify the generalizability and effectiveness of this method. The trial types included elbow joint motion with single cycle trials, typical cycle trials, gradually increasing amplitude trials, and random movement trials for handheld loads of 1.25 and 2.5 kg. The results revealed that the average root-mean-square errors ranged from 0.12 to 0.26 rad, reflecting an appropriate level of estimation accuracy.\nConclusion: Establishing a reasonable physiological model and applying an efficient optimization algorithm enabled more accurate estimation of the joint angle. The proposed method provides a theoretical foundation for robotic exoskeletons and powered exoskeletons to understand the intentions of human continuous motion."

Traditional control schemes are only capable of providing 2 degrees of freedom, which is insufficient for dexterous control of individual fingers. We present a framework where myoelectric signals from natural hand and finger movements can be decoded with a high accuracy. 32 surface-EMG electrodes were placed on the forearm of an able-bodied subject while performing individual finger movements. Using time-domain feature extraction methods as inputs to a neural network classifier, we show that 12 individuated flexion and extension movements of the fingers can be decoded with an accuracy higher than 98%. To our knowledge, this is the first instance in which such movements have been successfully decoded using surface-EMG. These preliminary findings provide a framework that will allow the results to be extended to non-invasive control of the next generation of upper-limb prostheses for amputees."

    "title": "Novel Method for Predicting Dexterous Individual Finger Movements by Imaging Muscle Activity Using a Wearable Ultrasonic System",
    "abstract": "Recently there have been major advances in the electro-mechanical design of upper extremity prosthetics. However, the development of control strategies for such prosthetics has lagged significantly behind. Conventional noninvasive myoelectric control strategies rely on the amplitude of electromyography (EMG) signals from flexor and extensor muscles in the forearm. Surface EMG has limited specificity for deep contiguous muscles because of cross talk and cannot reliably differentiate between individual digit and joint motions. We present a novel ultrasound imaging based control strategy for upper arm prosthetics that can overcome many of the limitations of myoelectric control. Real time ultrasound images of the forearm muscles were obtained using a wearable mechanically scanned single element ultrasound system, and analyzed to create maps of muscle activity based on changes in the ultrasound echogenicity of the muscle during contraction. Individual digit movements were associated with unique maps of activity. These maps were correlated with previously acquired training data to classify individual digit movements. Preliminary results using ten healthy volunteers demonstrated this approach could provide robust classification of individual finger movements with 98% accuracy (precision 96%-100% and recall 97%-100% for individual finger flexions). The change in ultrasound echogenicity was found to be proportional to the digit flexion speed (R(2)=0.9), and thus our proposed strategy provided a proportional signal that can be used for fine control. We anticipate that ultrasound imaging based control strategies could be a significant improvement over conventional myoelectric control of prosthetics."

    "abstract": "Human-robot control interfaces have received increased attention during the past decades. With the introduction of robots in everyday life, especially in providing services to people with special needs (i.e., elderly, people with impairments, or people with disabilities), there is a strong necessity for simple and natural control interfaces. In this paper, electromyographic (EMG) signals from muscles of the human upper limb are used as the control interface between the user and a robot arm. EMG signals are recorded using surface EMG electrodes placed on the user's skin, making the user's upper limb free of bulky interface sensors or machinery usually found in conventional human-controlled systems. The proposed interface allows the user to control in real time an anthropomorphic robot arm in 3-D space, using upper limb motion estimates based only on EMG recordings. Moreover, the proposed interface is robust to EMG changes with respect to time, mainly caused by muscle fatigue or adjustments of contraction level. The efficiency of the method is assessed through real-time experiments, including random arm motions in the 3-D space with variable hand speed profiles."

    "abstract": "We present a case study of a novel variation of the targeted sensory reinnervation technique that provides additional control over sensory restoration after transhumeral amputation. The use of intraoperative somatosensory evoked potentials on individual fascicles of the median and ulnar nerves allowed us to specifically target sensory fascicles to reroute to target cutaneous nerves at a distance away from anticipated motor sites in a transhumeral amputee. This resulted in restored hand maps of the median and ulnar nerve in discrete spatially separated areas. In addition, the subject was able to use native and reinnervated muscle sites to control a robotic arm while simultaneously sensing touch and force feedback from the robotic gripper in a physiologically correct manner. This proof of principle study is the first to demonstrate the ability to have simultaneous dual flow of information (motor and sensory) within the residual limb. In working towards clinical deployment of a sensory integrated prosthetic device, this surgical method addresses the important issue of restoring a usable access point to provide natural hand sensation after upper limb amputation."

Bilateral-mirrored contractions from ten able-bodied subjects were recorded along with isometric forces in multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) from the right wrist. An artificial neural network was trained to provide force estimation. Combinations of processing parameters were evaluated and an estimation algorithm allowing high accuracy from relatively short signal epochs (100 ms) was proposed. The estimation performance when using surface EMG from the contralateral limb was 0.90 ± 0.02 for the able-bodied subjects. In comparison, the estimation performance for one subject with congenital malformation of the left forearm was 0.72 which, albeit lower than for able-bodied subjects, is still comparable to or better than previously reported results. The proposed method requires only the measured forces from one limb, such as in the case of unilateral amputees and has thus the potential to be used in clinical settings for intuitive, simultaneous control of multiple DOFs in myoelectric prostheses."

In addition, the original manual for the use and administration of the AMAT was reviewed.\nStudy selection: All studies examining the psychometric properties of the AMAT or using the AMAT as an outcome measure were identified. Articles simply mentioning the AMAT without providing data and case reports or abstracts (other than those addressing a specific aspect of the scale of interest) were excluded.\nData extraction: Studies were reviewed by the primary author. No formal system of quality review was used.\nData synthesis: The AMAT has been used as an outcome measure in stroke rehabilitation research examining upper extremity robotics, functional electrical stimulation, and cortical stimulation. The most recent version contains 10 ADL tasks, each of which is composed of 1 to 3 subtasks. Of the 3 domains originally proposed, only the \"functional ability\" domain is routinely assessed. Psychometric studies have demonstrated good reliability and at least reasonable construct validity. The instrument's sensitivity to change over time is less well established, and no recommendation can be made regarding a minimal clinically important difference.\nConclusions: We recommend that the 10-item version of the AMAT and assessment of only the functional ability domain be adopted as standard going forward. Further research should include examination of sensitivity over time, minimal clinically important change, reliability and validity in the mid and lower range of scores, and in neurologic diagnoses other than stroke."

    "abstract": "Transhumeral amputation has a significant effect on a person's independence and quality of life. Myoelectric prostheses have the potential to restore upper limb function, however their use is currently limited due to lack of intuitive and natural control of multiple degrees of freedom. The goal of this study was to evaluate a novel transhumeral prosthesis controller that uses a combination of kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from the person's proximal humerus. Specifically, we trained a time-delayed artificial neural network to predict elbow flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination from six proximal EMG signals, and humeral angular velocity and linear acceleration. We evaluated this scheme with ten able-bodied subjects offline, as well as in a target-reaching task presented in an immersive virtual reality environment. The offline training had a target of 4° for flexion/extension and 8° for pronation/supination, which it easily exceeded (2.7° and 5.5° respectively). During online testing, all subjects completed the target-reaching task with path efficiency of 78% and minimal overshoot (1.5%). Thus, combining kinematic and muscle activity signals from the proximal humerus can provide adequate prosthesis control, and testing in a virtual reality environment can provide meaningful data on controller performance."

One is the use of progressive, skill acquisition-oriented training. Another approach emphasizes the use of bilateral activities. Building on these principles, this paper describes the design and feasibility testing of a robotic/virtual environment system designed to train the arm of persons who have had strokes. The system provides a variety of assistance modes, scalable workspaces and hand-robot interfaces allowing persons with strokes to train multiple joints in three dimensions. The simulations utilize assistance algorithms that adjust task difficulty both online and offline in relation to subject performance. Several distinctive haptic effects have been incorporated into the simulations. An adaptive master-slave relationship between the unimpaired and impaired arm encourages active movement of the subject's hemiparetic arm during a bimanual task. Adaptive anti-gravity support and damping stabilize the arm during virtual reaching and placement tasks. An adaptive virtual spring provides assistance to complete the movement if the subject is unable to complete the task in time. Finally, haptically rendered virtual objects help to shape the movement trajectory during a virtual placement task. A proof of concept study demonstrated this system to be safe, feasible and worthy of further study."

The functional electrical therapy (FET) encompasses three elements: 1) control of movements that are compromised because of the impairment, 2) enhanced exercise of paralyzed extremities, and 3) augmented activity of afferent neural pathway. Liberson et al. (1) first reported an important result of the FET; they applied a peroneal stimulator to enhance functionally essential ankle dorsiflexion during the swing phase of walking. Merletti et al. (2) described a similar electrotherapeutic effect for upper extremities; they applied a two-channel electronic stimulator and surface electrodes to augment elbow extension and finger extension during different reach and grasp activities. Both electrotherapies resulted in immediate and carry-over effects caused by systematic application of FET. In studies with subjects after a spinal cord lesion at the cervical level (chronic tetraplegia) (3-5) or stroke (6), it was shown that FET improves grasping and reaching by using the following outcome measures: the Upper Extremity Function Test (UEFT), coordination between elbow and shoulder movement, and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Externally applied electrical stimuli provided a strong central sensory input which could be responsible for the changes in the organization of impaired sensory-motor mechanisms. FET resulted in stronger muscles that were stimulated directly, as well as exercising other muscles. The ability to move paralyzed extremities also provided awareness (proprioception and visual feedback) of enhanced functional ability as being very beneficial for the recovery. FET contributed to the increased range of movement in the affected joints, increased speed of joint rotations, reduced spasticity, and improved functioning measured by the UEFT, the FIM and the Quadriplegia Index of Function (QIF)."

    "title": "Subcutaneous abdominal artificial tears pump-reservoir for severe dry eye",
    "abstract": "Purpose: To assay a totally implanted pump-reservoir unit placed under the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen for providing artificial tears to the ocular surface in patients with severe dry eye.\nDesign: Prospective non-randomized comparative (self-controlled) trial.\nParticipants: Six patients with severe dry eye, in whom intermittent moistening of the ocular surface with current collyria was clinically unsatisfactory.\nMethods: The six patients were treated by implanting an artificial tear pump-reservoir unit under the subcutaneous tissues of the abdomen. The reservoir is operated by a gas pump, which pumps artificial tears to the eye from a 60-ml reservoir through a silicone tube leading subcutaneously from the reservoir, via the chest, neck and lateral part of the head, and entering the conjunctival sac over the lateral canthal ligament. The catheter is anchored to the aponeurosis of the temporal muscle at the lateral rim of the orbit with a butterfly sleeve. The terminal portion of the tube runs freely along the upper conjunctival fornix, and pours 1.5 ml/day of the artificial tears into the ocular lacrimal basin with a constant flow rate. The reservoir must be refilled by percutaneous injection of artificial tears every 45 days.\nMain outcome measures: Schirmer test, corneal fluorescein staining, lacrimal film breakup time, lacrimal osmolarity, corneal impression cytology, best-corrected visual acuity, dryness sensation and blepharospasm before and after lacrimal reservoir implantation.\nResults: The lacrimal subcutaneous abdominal reservoir was well tolerated with little discomfort. A delivery of 1.5 ml/day was enough to maintain a comfortable wet eye. After an average follow-up of 15 months the signs and symptoms of dry eye were dramatically improved. Four of the patients had a severe blepharospasm, which disappeared some weeks after the implantation of the lacrimal abdominal reservoir.\nConclusion: These are the first totally implanted lacrimal reservoirs in human beings. They have proved to be a good solution for severe dry eye. At present, this method is the only one that permits a maintained wet eye surface, and the performance of corneal, conjunctival, limbal and amniotic membrane transplants in total or almost total xerophthalmia. It may also be a good solution for some of the so-called essential blepharospasms, which are frequently triggered by an underlying dry eye."

    "title": "Closed-Loop Task Difficulty Adaptation during Virtual Reality Reach-to-Grasp Training Assisted with an Exoskeleton for Stroke Rehabilitation",
    "abstract": "Stroke patients with severe motor deficits of the upper extremity may practice rehabilitation exercises with the assistance of a multi-joint exoskeleton. Although this technology enables intensive task-oriented training, it may also lead to slacking when the assistance is too supportive. Preserving the engagement of the patients while providing \"assistance-as-needed\" during the exercises, therefore remains an ongoing challenge. We applied a commercially available seven degree-of-freedom arm exoskeleton to provide passive gravity compensation during task-oriented training in a virtual environment. During this 4-week pilot study, five severely affected chronic stroke patients performed reach-to-grasp exercises resembling activities of daily living. The subjects received virtual reality feedback from their three-dimensional movements. The level of difficulty for the exercise was adjusted by a performance-dependent real-time adaptation algorithm. The goal of this algorithm was the automated improvement of the range of motion. In the course of 20 training and feedback sessions, this unsupervised adaptive training concept led to a progressive increase of the virtual training space (p < 0.001) in accordance with the subjects' abilities. This learning curve was paralleled by a concurrent improvement of real world kinematic parameters, i.e., range of motion (p = 0.008), accuracy of movement (p = 0.01), and movement velocity (p < 0.001). Notably, these kinematic gains were paralleled by motor improvements such as increased elbow movement (p = 0.001), grip force (p < 0.001), and upper extremity Fugl-Meyer-Assessment score from 14.3 ± 5 to 16.9 ± 6.1 (p = 0.026). Combining gravity-compensating assistance with adaptive closed-loop feedback in virtual reality provides customized rehabilitation environments for severely affected stroke patients. This approach may facilitate motor learning by progressively challenging the subject in accordance with the individual capacity for functional restoration. It might be necessary to apply concurrent restorative interventions to translate these improvements into relevant functional gains of severely motor impaired patients in activities of daily living."

    "title": "A novel approach to stroke rehabilitation: robot-aided sensorimotor stimulation",
    "abstract": "Objective: In patients with stroke, the authors tested whether additional sensorimotor training of the paralyzed or paretic upper limb delivered by a robotic device enhanced motor outcome.\nMethods: Fifty-six patients with stroke and hemiparesis or hemiplegia received standard poststroke multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and were randomly assigned either to receive robotic training (at least 25 hours) or exposure to the robotic device without training. Outcomes were assessed by the same masked raters, before treatment began and at the end of treatment, with the upper extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment, the Motor Status score, the Motor Power score, and Functional Independence Measurement.\nResult: The robot treatment and control group had comparable clinical characteristics, lesion size, and pretreatment impairment scores. By the end of treatment, the robot-trained group demonstrated improvement in motor outcome for the trained shoulder and elbow (Motor Power score, p < 0.001; Motor Status score, p < 0. 01) that did not generalize to untrained wrist and hand. The robot-treated group also demonstrated significantly improved functional outcome (Functional Independence Measurement-Motor, p < 0. 01).\nConclusion: Robot-delivered quantitative and reproducible sensorimotor training enhanced the motor performance of the exercised shoulder and elbow. The robot-treated group also demonstrated improved functional outcome. When added to standard multidisciplinary rehabilitation, robotics provides novel therapeutic strategies that focus on impairment reduction and improved motor performance."

    "title": "Efficacy and stability performance of traditional versus motion sensor-assisted strategies for FES standing",
    "abstract": "Standing by means of functional electrical stimulation (FES) after spinal cord injury is a topic widely reported in the neurorehabilitation literature. This practice commonly uses surface stimulation over the quadriceps muscle to evoke knee extension. To date, most FES neuroprostheses still operate without any artificial feedback, meaning that after a fatigue-driven knee buckle event, the stimulation amplitude or pulse width must be increased manually via button presses to re-establish knee-lock. This is often referred to as 'hand-controlled (HC) operation'. In an attempt to provide a safer, yet clinically practical approach, this study proposed two novel strategies to automate the control of knee extension based on the kinematic feedback of four miniaturised motion sensors. These strategies were compared to the traditional HC strategy on four individuals with complete paraplegia. The standing times observed over multiple trials were in general longer for the automated strategies when compared to HC (0.5-80%). With the automated strategies, three of the subjects tended to need less upper body support over a frame to maintain balance. A stability analysis based on centre of pressure (CoP) measurements also favoured the automated strategies. This analysis also revealed that although FES standing with the assistance of a frame was likely to be safe for the subjects, their stability was still inferior to that of able-bodied individuals. Overall, the unpredictability of knee buckle events could be more effectively controlled by automated FES strategies to re-establish knee-lock when compared to the traditional user-controlled approach, thus demonstrating the safety and clinical efficacy of an automated approach."

    "title": "Wrist action affects precision grip force",
    "abstract": "When moving objects with a precision grip, fingertip forces normal to the object surface (grip force) change in parallel with forces tangential to the object (load force). We investigated whether voluntary wrist actions can affect grip force independent of load force, because the extrinsic finger muscles cross the wrist. Grip force increased with wrist angular speed during wrist motion in the horizontal plane, and was much larger than the increased tangential load at the fingertips or the reaction forces from linear acceleration of the test object. During wrist flexion the index finger muscles in the hand and forearm increased myoelectric activity; during wrist extension this myoelectric activity increased little, or decreased for some subjects. The grip force maxima coincided with wrist acceleration maxima, and grip force remained elevated when subjects held the wrist in extreme flexion or extension. Likewise, during isometric wrist actions the grip force increased even though the fingertip loads remained constant. A grip force \"pulse\" developed that increased with wrist force rate, followed by a static grip force while the wrist force was sustained. Subjects could not suppress the grip force pulse when provided visual feedback of their grip force. We conclude that the extrinsic hand muscles can be recruited to assist the intended wrist action, yielding higher grip-load ratios than those employed with the wrist at rest. This added drive to hand muscles overcame any loss in muscle force while the extrinsic finger flexors shortened during wrist flexion motion. During wrist extension motion grip force increases apparently occurred from eccentric contraction of the extrinsic finger flexors. The coactivation of hand closing muscles with other wrist muscles also may result in part from a general motor facilitation, because grip force increased during isometric knee extension. However, these increases were related weakly to the knee force. The observed muscle coactivation, from all sources, may contribute to grasp stability. For example, when transporting grasped objects, upper limb accelerations simultaneously produce inertial torques at the wrist that must be resisted, and inertial loads at the fingertips from the object that must be offset by increased grip force. The muscle coactivation described here would cause similarly timed pulses in the wrist force and grip force. However, grip-load coupling from this mechanism would not contribute much to grasp stability when small wrist forces are required, such as for slow movements or when the object's total resistive load is small."

    "title": "Raised corticomotor excitability of M1 forearm area following anodal tDCS is sustained during robotic wrist therapy in chronic stroke",
    "abstract": "Purpose: Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can transiently increase corticomotor excitability of intrinsic hand muscles and improve upper limb function in patients with chronic stroke. As a preliminary study, we tested whether increased corticomotor excitability would be similarly observed in muscles acting about the wrist, and remain present during robotic training involving active wrist movements, in six chronic stroke patients with residual motor deficit.\nMethods: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) generated motor evoked potentials (MEP) in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and provided a measure of corticomotor excitability and short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) before and immediately after a period of tDCS (1 mA, 20 min, anode and TMS applied to the lesioned hemisphere), and robotic wrist training (1hr).\nResults: Following tDCS, the same TMS current strength evoked an increased MEP amplitude (mean 168 +/- 22%SEM; p < 0.05), that remained increased after robot training (166 +/- 23%; p < 0.05). Conditioned MEPs were of significantly lower amplitude relative to unconditioned MEPs prior to tDCS (62 +/- 6%, p < 0.05), but not after tDCS (89 +/- 14%, p = 0.40), or robot training (91 +/- 8%, p = 0.28), suggesting that the increased corticomotor excitability is associated with reduced intracortical inhibition.\nConclusion: The persistence of these effects after robotic motor training, indicates that a motor learning and retraining program can co-exist with tDCS-induced changes in cortical motor excitability, and supports the concept of combining brain stimulation with physical therapy to promote recovery after brain injury."

    "title": "Learning to use a body-powered prosthesis: changes in functionality and kinematics",
    "abstract": "Background: Little is known about action-perception learning processes underlying prosthetic skills in body-powered prosthesis users. Body-powered prostheses are controlled through a harness connected by a cable that might provide for limited proprioceptive feedback. This study aims to test transfer of training basic tasks to functional tasks and to describe the changes over time in kinematics of basic tasks of novice body-powered prosthesis users.\nMethods: Thirty able-bodied participants and 17 controls participated in the study, using a body-powered prosthetic simulator. Participants in the training group were divided over four groups and practiced during a 2-week-period either direct grasping, indirect grasping, fixation, or a combination of these tasks. Deformable objects with different compliances had to be manipulated while kinematic variables and grip force control were assessed. Functional performance was measured with the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) prior to and after the training sessions, and after 2 weeks and 3 months retention. The control group only performed the SHAP tests.\nResults: All four training groups and the control group improved on the SHAP, also after a period of non-use. Type of training had a small but significant influence on the improvements of the SHAP score. On a kinematic level movement times decreased and hook closing velocities increased over time. The indirect grasping group showed significantly shorter plateau times than the other training groups. Grip force control only improved a little over training.\nConclusions: Training action-perception couplings of body-powered prosthesis in basic tasks transferred to functional tasks and this lasted after a period of non-use. During training movement times decreased and the indirect grasping group showed advantages. It is advisable to start body-powered training with indirect grasping tasks but also to practice hook-object orientations."

    "title": "Real-time and offline performance of pattern recognition myoelectric control using a generic electrode grid with targeted muscle reinnervation patients",
    "abstract": "Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is a surgical technique that creates myoelectric prosthesis control sites for high-level amputees. The electromyographic (EMG) signal patterns provided by the reinnervated muscles are well-suited for pattern recognition control. Pattern recognition allows for control of a greater number of degrees of freedom (DOF) than the conventional, EMG amplitude-based approach. Previous pattern recognition studies have shown benefit in placing electrodes directly over the reinnervated muscles. Localizing the optimal TMR locations is inconvenient and time consuming. In this contribution, we demonstrate that a clinically practical grid arrangement of electrodes yields real-time control performance that is equivalent to, or better than, the site-specific electrode placement for simultaneous control of multiple DOFs using pattern recognition. Additional findings indicate that grid-like electrode arrangement yields significantly lower classification errors for classifiers with a large number of movement classes ( > 9). These findings suggest that a grid electrode arrangement can be effectively used to control a multi-DOF upper limb prosthesis while reducing the time and effort associated with fitting the prosthesis due to clinical localization of control sites on amputee patients."

    "title": "The effects of electromechanical wrist robot assistive system with neuromuscular electrical stimulation for stroke rehabilitation",
    "abstract": "An electromyography (EMG)-driven electromechanical robot system integrated with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) was developed for wrist training after stroke. The performance of the system in assisting wrist flexion/extension tracking was evaluated on five chronic stroke subjects, when the system provided five different schemes with or without NMES and robot assistance. The tracking performances were measured by range of motion (ROM) of the wrist and root mean squared error (RMSE). The performance is better when both NMES and robot assisted in the tracking than those with either NMES or robot only (P<0.05). The muscle co-contractions in the upper limb measured by EMG were reduced when NMES provided assistance (P<0.05). All subjects also attended a 20-session wrist training for evaluating the training effects (3-5 times/week). The results showed improvements on the voluntary motor functions in the hand, wrist and elbow functions after the training, as indicated by the clinical scores of Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Action Research Arm Test, Wolf Motor Function Test; and also showed reduced spasticity in the wrist and the elbow as measured by the Modified Ashworth Score of each subject. After the training, the co-contractions were reduced between the flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis, and between the biceps brachii and triceps brachii. Assistance from the robot helped improve the movement accuracy; and the NMES helped increase the muscle activation for the wrist joint and suppress the excessive muscular activities from the elbow joint. The NMES-robot assisted wrist training could improve the hand, wrist, and elbow functions."

    "title": "Linear and nonlinear regression techniques for simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control",
    "abstract": "In recent years the number of active controllable joints in electrically powered hand-prostheses has increased significantly. However, the control strategies for these devices in current clinical use are inadequate as they require separate and sequential control of each degree-of-freedom (DoF). In this study we systematically compare linear and nonlinear regression techniques for an independent, simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control of wrist movements with two DoF. These techniques include linear regression, mixture of linear experts (ME), multilayer-perceptron, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). They are investigated offline with electro-myographic signals acquired from ten able-bodied subjects and one person with congenital upper limb deficiency. The control accuracy is reported as a function of the number of electrodes and the amount and diversity of training data providing guidance for the requirements in clinical practice. The results showed that KRR, a nonparametric statistical learning method, outperformed the other methods. However, simple transformations in the feature space could linearize the problem, so that linear models could achieve similar performance as KRR at much lower computational costs. Especially ME, a physiologically inspired extension of linear regression represents a promising candidate for the next generation of prosthetic devices."

    "abstract": "Electrocorticogram (ECoG)-based brain computer interfaces (BCI) can potentially be used for control of arm prostheses. Restoring independent function to BCI users with such a system will likely require control of many degrees-of-freedom (DOF). However, our ability to decode many-DOF arm movements from ECoG signals has not been thoroughly tested. To this end, we conducted a comprehensive study of the ECoG signals underlying 6 elementary upper extremity movements. Two subjects undergoing ECoG electrode grid implantation for epilepsy surgery evaluation participated in the study. For each task, their data were analyzed to design a decoding model to classify ECoG as idling or movement. The decoding models were found to be highly sensitive in detecting movement, but not specific in distinguishing between different movement types. Since sensitivity and specificity must be traded-off, these results imply that conventional ECoG grids may not provide sufficient resolution for decoding many-DOF upper extremity movements."

    "title": "Differentiating Variations in Thumb Position From Recordings of the Surface Electromyogram in Adults Performing Static Grips, a Proof of Concept Study",
    "abstract": "Hand gesture and grip formations are produced by the muscle synergies arising between extrinsic and intrinsic hand muscles and many functional hand movements involve repositioning of the thumb relative to other digits. In this study we explored whether changes in thumb posture in able-body volunteers can be identified and classified from the modulation of forearm muscle surface-electromyography (sEMG) alone without reference to activity from the intrinsic musculature. In this proof-of-concept study, our goal was to determine if there is scope to develop prosthetic hand control systems that may incorporate myoelectric thumb-position control. Healthy volunteers performed a controlled-isometric grip task with their thumb held in four different opposing-postures. Grip force during task performance was maintained at 30% maximal-voluntary-force and sEMG signals from the forearm were recorded using 2D high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG arrays). Correlations between sEMG amplitude and root-mean squared estimates with variation in thumb-position were investigated using principal-component analysis and self-organizing feature maps. Results demonstrate that forearm muscle sEMG patterns possess classifiable parameters that correlate with variations in static thumb position (accuracy of 88.25 ± 0.5% anterior; 91.25 ± 2.5% posterior musculature of the forearm sites). Of importance, this suggests that in transradial amputees, despite the loss of access to the intrinsic muscles that control thumb action, an acceptable level of control over a thumb component within myoelectric devices may be achievable. Accordingly, further work exploring the potential to provide myoelectric control over the thumb within a prosthetic hand is warranted."

The robots to be developed will bring about cost-effective, safe and easier at-home rehabilitation to most motor-function impaired patients (MIPs). In our previous research, a full framework was established towards this research goal. In this research, we aimed at improving the human activity recognition by using contour data of the tracked human subject extracted from the depth images as the signal source, instead of the lower limb joint angle data used in the previous research, which are more likely to be affected by the motion of the robot and human subjects. Several geometric parameters, such as, the ratio of height to weight of the tracked human subject, and distance (pixels) between centroid points of upper and lower parts of human body, were calculated from the contour data, and used as the features for the activity recognition. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is employed to classify different human activities from the features. Experimental results showed that the human activity recognition could be achieved with a high correct rate."

    "abstract": "The effect of electrode position on the upper trapezius muscle on the myo-electric signal amplitude was investigated with special reference to arm position and estimate of force output. Previously, a depression of the electromyogram (EMG) signal has been reported midway between the seventh cervical vertebrae (C7) and acromion (Veiersted 1991, Eur J Appl Physiol 62:91-98) although this electrode position has been recommended (Zipp 1982, Eur J Appl Physiol 50: 41-54). Ten healthy subjects performed maximal shoulder elevations with the arm in vertical, abducted and flexed positions and they performed a dynamic movement test. The myo-electric signal was recorded along the length of the right upper trapezius muscle by a 16-channel bipolar array electrode and was integrated with a 0.2-s time resolution. A region just lateral to the midpoint between C7 and the lateral edge of acromion was found with high and stable amplitudes (% coefficient of variation equalled 5.6). At the midpoint a dip in the amplitude profile appeared which was slightly displaced by arm abduction or flexion probably due to sliding of the skin relative to the muscle. A linear EMG-force relationship was found in the region with high signal amplitudes, whereas the more lateral and the dip region showed highly variable EMG-force relationships. Thus, it was found that when using bipolar surface electrodes with an interelectrode distance of 2 cm a centre position 2 cm lateral to the midpoint between C7 and acromion provided good repeatability and high signal yield."

Can the application of force to limbs improve motor learning? In this framework, the response to altered dynamic environments of children affected by primary dystonia has never been studied.\nMethods: As preliminary pilot study, eleven children with primary dystonia and eleven age-matched healthy control subjects were asked to perform upper limb movements, triangle-reaching (three directions) and circle-writing, using a haptic robot interacting with ad-hoc developed task-specific visual interfaces. Three dynamic conditions were provided, null additive external force (A), constant disturbing force (B) and deactivation of the additive external force again (C). The path length for each trial was computed, from the recorded position data and interaction events.\nResults: The results show that the disturbing force affects significantly the movement outcomes in healthy but not in dystonic subjects, already compromised in the reference condition: the external alteration uncalibrates the healthy sensorimotor system, while the dystonic one is already strongly uncalibrated. The lack of systematic compensation for perturbation effects during B condition is reflected into the absence of after-effects in C condition, which would be the evidence that CNS generates a prediction of the perturbing forces using an internal model of the environment.The most promising finding is that in dystonic population the altered dynamic exposure seems to induce a subsequent improvement, i.e. a beneficial after-effect in terms of optimal path control, compared with the correspondent reference movement outcome.\nConclusions: The short-time error-enhancing training in dystonia could represent an effective approach for motor performance improvement, since the exposure to controlled dynamic alterations induces a refining of the existing but strongly imprecise motor scheme and sensorimotor patterns."

    "title": "The influence of artificially increased hip and trunk stiffness on balance control in man",
    "abstract": "Lightweight corsets were used to produce mid-body stiffening, rendering the hip and trunk joints practically inflexible. To examine the effect of this artificially increased stiffness on balance control, we perturbed the upright stance of young subjects (20-34 years of age) while they wore one of two types of corset or no corset at all. One type, the \"half-corset\", only increased hip stiffness, and the other, the \"full-corset\", increased stiffness of the hips and trunk. The perturbations consisted of combined roll and pitch rotations of the support surface (7.5 deg, 60 deg/s) in one of six different directions. Outcome measures were biomechanical responses of the legs, trunk, arms and head, and electromyographic (EMG) responses from leg, trunk, and upper arm muscles. With the full-corset, a decrease in forward stabilising trunk pitch rotation compared to the no-corset condition occurred for backward pitch tilts of the support surface. In contrast, the half-corset condition yielded increased forward trunk motion. Trunk backward pitch motion after forwards support-surface perturbations was the same for all corset conditions. Ankle torques and lower leg angle changes in the pitch direction were decreased for both corset conditions for forward pitch tilts of the support-surface but unaltered for backward tilts. Changes in trunk roll motion with increased stiffness were profound. After onset of a roll support-surface perturbation, the trunk rolled in the opposite direction to the support-surface tilt for the no-corset and half-corset conditions, but in the same direction as the tilt for the full-corset condition. Initial head roll angular accelerations (at 100 ms) were larger for the full-corset condition but in the same direction (opposite platform tilt) for all conditions. Arm roll movements were initially in the same direction as trunk movements, and were followed by large compensatory arm movements only for the full-corset condition. Leg muscle (soleus, peroneus longus, but not tibialis anterior) balance-correcting responses were reduced for roll and pitch tilts under both corset conditions. Responses in paraspinals were also reduced. These results indicate that young healthy normals cannot rapidly modify movement strategies sufficiently to account for changes in link flexibility following increases in hip and trunk stiffness. The changes in leg and trunk muscle responses failed to achieve a normal roll or pitch trunk end position at 700 ms (except for forward tilt rotations), even though head accelerations and trunk joint proprioception seemed to provide information on changed trunk movement profiles over the first 300 ms following the perturbation. The major adaptation to stiffness involved increased use of arm movements to regain stability. The major differences in trunk motion for the no-corset, half-corset and full-corset conditions support the concept of a multi-link pendulum with different control dynamics in the pitch and roll planes as a model of human stance. Stiffening of the hip and trunk increases the likelihood of a loss of balance laterally and/or backwards. Thus, these results may have implications for the elderly and others, with and without disease states, who stiffen for a variety of reasons."

Usability and satisfaction were evaluated using the Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scale (TAPES) and study-specific usability and satisfaction scales. Descriptive statistics were examined and prototypes compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum. Results were stratified by configuration level and outcomes compared by prototype. Satisfaction and usability were greater for gen 3 than gen 2. Overall TAPES scores were similar; however, scores of the TAPES aesthetic satisfaction subscale were higher for gen 3. Compared with gen 2 users, gen 3 users were more satisfied with appearance, grips, and doffing and rated overall usability higher. Features of gen 3, including weight, external cables and wires, hand covering, and fingernails, would benefit from further optimization."

The present study aimed at developing a novel sensory-enhanced robot-aided motor training program and testing its feasibility in stroke rehabilitation. A specially designed robot handle was developed as an attachment to the Inmotion2 robotic system. This handle provided sensory stimulation through pins connected to small servo motors inside the handle. Vibration of the pins was activated during motor training once pressure on the handle reached a certain threshold indicating an active motion of the study subject. Nine chronic stroke survivors were randomly assigned to either a sensory-enhanced robot-aided motor training group (SERMT) or robot-aided motor training only group (RMT). All participants underwent a 6-week motor training program, performing target reaching movements with the specialized handle with or without vibration stimulation during training. Motor Status (MS) scores were measured for functional outcome prior to and after training. The results showed significant improvement in the total MS scores after training in both experimental groups. However, MS sub-scores for the shoulder/elbow and the wrist/hand increased significantly only in the SERMT group (p<0.05). Future studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings."

Data were gathered as part of a hybrid robotic and traditional upper extremity rehabilitation program for nine stroke patients. Smoothness of movement and trajectory error, temporally and spatially normalized measures of movement quality defined for point-to-point movements, were found to have significant moderate to strong correlations with all four of the clinical measures. The strong correlations suggest that smoothness of movement and trajectory error may be used to compare outcomes of different rehabilitation protocols and devices effectively, provide improved resolution for tracking patient progress compared to only pre- and post-treatment measurements, enable accurate adaptation of therapy based on patient progress, and deliver immediate and useful feedback to the patient and therapist."

    "title": "Temporal Asynchrony but Not Total Energy Nor Duration Improves the Judgment of Numerosity in Electrotactile Stimulation",
    "abstract": "Stroke patients suffer from impairments of both motor and somatosensory functions. The functional recovery of upper extremities is one of the primary goals of rehabilitation programs. Additional somatosensory deficits limit sensorimotor function and significantly affect its recovery after the neuromotor injury. Sensory substitution systems, providing tactile feedback, might facilitate manipulation capability, and improve patient's dexterity during grasping movements. As a first step toward this aim, we evaluated the ability of healthy subjects in exploiting electrotactile feedback on the shoulder to determine the number of perceived stimuli in numerosity judgment tasks. During the experiment, we compared four different stimulation patterns (two simultaneous: short and long, intermittent and sequential) differing in total duration, total energy, or temporal synchrony. The experiment confirmed that the subject ability to enumerate electrotactile stimuli decreased with increasing the number of active electrodes. Furthermore, we found that, in electrotactile stimulation, the temporal coding schemes, and not total energy or duration modulated the accuracy in numerosity judgment. More precisely, the sequential condition resulted in significantly better numerosity discrimination than intermittent and simultaneous stimulation. These findings, together with the fact that the shoulder appeared to be a feasible stimulation site to communicate tactile information via electrotactile feedback, can serve as a guide to deliver tactile feedback to proximal areas in stroke survivors who lack sensory integrity in distal areas of their affected arm, but retain motor skills."

    "title": "A Method of Recognizing Finger Motion Using Wavelet Transform of Surface EMG Signal",
    "abstract": "In this paper, an identification method of finger motions using the wavelet transform of multi-channel electromyography (EMG) signal is presented. The first step of this method is to analyze surface EMG signal detected from the subject's upper arm using the multi-resolution of wavelet transform, and extract features using the variance, maximum and mean absolute value of the wavelet coefficients. In this way, a new feature space is established by wavelet coefficients. The second step is to import the feature values into an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to identify the finger motion. Based on the results of experiments, it is concluded that this method is effective in identification of finger motion. Thus, it provides an alternative approach to use the surface EMG in controlling the finger motion of a multi-fingered prosthetic hand."

    "title": "Design strategies to improve patient motivation during robot-aided rehabilitation",
    "abstract": "Background: Motivation is an important factor in rehabilitation and frequently used as a determinant of rehabilitation outcome. Several factors can influence patient motivation and so improve exercise adherence. This paper presents the design of two robot devices for use in the rehabilitation of upper limb movements, that can motivate patients during the execution of the assigned motor tasks by enhancing the gaming aspects of rehabilitation. In addition, a regular review of the obtained performance can reinforce in patients' minds the importance of exercising and encourage them to continue, so improving their motivation and consequently adherence to the program. In view of this, we also developed an evaluation metric that could characterize the rate of improvement and quantify the changes in the obtained performance.\nMethods: Two groups (G1, n = 8 and G2, n = 12) of patients with chronic stroke were enrolled in a 3-week rehabilitation program including standard physical therapy (45 min. daily) plus treatment by means of robot devices (40 min., twice daily) respectively for wrist (G1) and elbow-shoulder movements (G2). Both groups were evaluated by means of standard clinical assessment scales and the new robot measured evaluation metric. Patients' motivation was assessed in 9/12 G2 patients by means of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) questionnaire.\nResults: Both groups reduced their motor deficit and showed a significant improvement in clinical scales and the robot measured parameters. The IMI assessed in G2 patients showed high scores for interest, usefulness and importance subscales and low values for tension and pain subscales.\nConclusion: Thanks to the design features of the two robot devices the therapist could easily adapt training to the individual by selecting different difficulty levels of the motor task tailored to each patient's disability. The gaming aspects incorporated in the two rehabilitation robots helped maintain patients' interest high during execution of the assigned tasks by providing feedback on performance. The evaluation metric gave a precise measure of patients' performance and thus provides a tool to help therapists promote patient motivation and hence adherence to the training program."

    "title": "Physiological and behavioral effects of β-tACS on brain self-regulation in chronic stroke",
    "abstract": "Background: Unlike in healthy controls, sensorimotor β-desynchronization (β-ERD) is compromised in stroke patients, i.e., the more severe the patient's motor impairment, the less β-ERD. This, in turn, provides a target substrate for therapeutic brain self-regulation and neurofeedback.\nObjective: Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate brain oscillations during and after stimulation, and may thus facilitate brain self-regulation during neurofeedback interventions.\nMethods: Twenty severely impaired, chronic stroke patients performed kinesthetic motor-imagery while a brain-robot interface transformed β-ERD (17-23 Hz) of the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex into opening of the paralyzed hand by a robotic orthosis. In a parallel group design, β-tACS (20 Hz, 1.1 mA peak-to-peak amplitude) was applied to the lesioned motor cortex either continuously (c-tACS) before or intermittently (i-tACS) during the intervention. Physiological effects of β-tACS were studied using electroencephalography. The patients' ability for brain self-regulation was captured by neurofeedback performance metrics.\nResults: i-tACS - but not c-tACS - improved the classification accuracy of the neurofeedback intervention in comparison to baseline. This effect was mediated via the increased specificity of the classification, i.e., reduced variance of resting oscillations. Neither i-tACS nor c-tACS had aftereffects following the stimulation period.\nConclusion: β-tACS may constitute an adjunct neuromodulation technique during neurofeedback-based interventions for stroke rehabilitation."

    "title": "Identification of Upper-Limb Movements Based on Muscle Shape Change Signals for Human-Robot Interaction",
    "abstract": "Towards providing efficient human-robot interaction, surface electromyogram (EMG) signals have been widely adopted for the identification of different limb movement intentions. Since the available EMG signal sensors are highly susceptible to external interferences such as electromagnetic artifacts and muscle fatigues, the quality of EMG recordings would be mostly corrupted, which may decay the performance of EMG-based control systems. Given the fact that the muscle shape changes (MSC) would be different when doing various limb movements, the MSC signal would be nonsensitive to electromagnetic artifacts and muscle fatigues and maybe promising for movement intention recognition. In this study, a novel nanogold flexible and stretchable sensor was developed for the acquisition of MSC signals utilized for decoding multiple classes of limb movement intents. More precisely, four sensors were used to measure the MSC signals from the right forearm of each subject when they performed seven classes of movements. Also, six different features were extracted from the measured MSC signals, and a linear discriminant analysis- (LDA-) based classifier was built for movement classification tasks. The experimental results showed that using MSC signals could achieve an average recognition rate of about 96.06 ± 1.84% by properly placing the four flexible and stretchable sensors on the forearm. Additionally, when the MSC sampling rate was greater than 100 Hz and the analysis window length was greater than 20 ms, the movement recognition accuracy would be only slightly increased. These pilot results suggest that the MSC-based method should be feasible in movement identifications for human-robot interaction, and at the same time, they provide a systematic reference for the use of the flexible and stretchable sensors in human-robot interaction systems."

    "title": "Shoulder and forearm oxygenation and myoelectric activity in patients with work-related muscle pain and healthy subjects",
    "abstract": "We tested hypotheses of (a) reduced oxygen usage, oxygen recovery, blood flow and oxygen consumption; and (b) increased muscle activity for patients diagnosed with work-related muscle pain (WRMP) in comparison to healthy controls. Oxygenation was measured with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and muscle activity with EMG for the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and trapezius descendens (TD) muscles. Eighteen patients with diffuse neck-shoulder-arm pain and 17 controls (matched in age and sex) were equipped with NIRS and EMG probes. After determining an individual's maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force, short-term (20 s) isometric contractions for the ECR and TD of 10, 30, 50 and 70 % MVC generated ∆StO₂ and StO₂% recovery (Rslope) from NIRS, and RMS%max from EMG signals. In addition, upper arm venous (VO) and arterial (AO) occlusions generated slopes of total hemoglobin (HbTslope) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHbslope) for the resting ECR as surrogates of blood flow and oxygen consumption, respectively. Mixed model analyses, t tests, and Mann-Whitney test were used to assess differences between groups. There was no significant difference in MVC between groups for either muscle. Also, ∆StO₂%, Rslope for either muscle, and ECR-HbTslope were not different between groups, thus our hypotheses of reduced oxygen use, recovery, and blood flow for patients were not confirmed. However, patients had a significantly lower ECR-HHbslope confirming our hypothesis of reduced consumption. Further, there was no difference in RMS%max during contractions meaning that the hypothesis of increased activity for patients was not confirmed. When taking into account the number of NIRS variables studied, differences we found between our patient group and healthy controls (i.e., in forearm oxygen consumption and shoulder oxygen saturation level) may be considered modest. Overall our findings may have been impacted by the fact that our patients and controls were similar in muscle strength, which is in contrast to previous studies."

    "title": "A novel rehabilitation system for upper limbs",
    "abstract": "Rehabilitation system for upper limbs is the device of implementing rehabilitation for patients' wounded limbs instead of therapists. According to review the development of rehabilitation system, we find some deficiencies such as insufficient movement space, few exact evaluations for impairment, and inadequate support for serious hemiplegia. Aiming at these problems, a novel rehabilitation system for upper limbs based on sEMG (surface electromyographic) signal is developed. The proposed system imitates human arm movements and can implement space motion because of its 5 DOF. As a diagnostic tool, the system is introduced sEMG, which is considered as the main basis of evaluation for motor function impairment. Software is developed to analyze sEMG signal during the movements to obtain valid characteristic parameters with time-, frequency-, and time-frequency-domain analytical methods. These parameters are associated with those of other sensor signals such as joint torque, joint angle, and force to quantify motor function injury. As a therapeutic tool, it can provide effective plans based on the parameters mentioned above. During the course of exercises, changes of each sensor signal and their characteristic parameters can be detected and monitored on the intuitive software interface, which can guide the device to carry out trainings. It provides a good platform for researching of sEMG signal and provides a new path for clinic hemiplegia upper limb therapy."

    "title": "Learning, Generalization, and Scalability of Abstract Myoelectric Control",
    "abstract": "Motor learning-based methods offer an alternative paradigm to machine learning-based methods for controlling upper-limb prosthetics. Within this paradigm, the patterns of muscular activity used for control can differ from those which control biological limbs. Practice expedites the learning of these new, functional patterns of muscular activity. We envisage that these methods can result in enhanced control without increasing device complexity. However, key questions about training protocols, generalisation and scalability of motor learning-based methods have remained. In this work, we pursue three objectives: 1) to validate the motor learning-based abstract myoelectric control approach with people with upper-limb difference for the first time; 2) to test whether, after training, participants can generalize their learning to tasks of increased difficulty; and 3) to show that abstract myoelectric control scales with additional input signals, offering a larger control range. In three experiments, 25 limb-intact participants and 8 people with a limb difference (congenital and acquired) experienced a motor learning-based myoelectric controlled interface. We show that participants with upper-limb difference can learn to control the interface and that performance increases with experience. Across experiments, participant performance on easier lower target density tasks generalized to more difficult higher target density tasks. A proof-of-concept study demonstrates that learning-based control scales with additional myoelectric channels. Our results show that human motor learning-based approaches can enhance the number of distinct outputs from the musculature, thereby increasing the functionality of prosthetic hands and providing a viable alternative to machine learning."

    "abstract": "A learning scheme based on random forests is used to discriminate between different reach to grasp movements in 3-D space, based on the myoelectric activity of human muscles of the upper-arm and the forearm. Task specificity for motion decoding is introduced in two different levels: Subspace to move toward and object to be grasped. The discrimination between the different reach to grasp strategies is accomplished with machine learning techniques for classification. The classification decision is then used in order to trigger an EMG-based task-specific motion decoding model. Task specific models manage to outperform \"general\" models providing better estimation accuracy. Thus, the proposed scheme takes advantage of a framework incorporating both a classifier and a regressor that cooperate advantageously in order to split the task space. The proposed learning scheme can be easily used to a series of EMG-based interfaces that must operate in real time, providing data-driven capabilities for multiclass problems, that occur in everyday life complex environments."

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose. Training in the virtual environment in post stroke rehab is being established as a new approach for neurorehabilitation, specifically, ReoTherapy (REO) a robot-assisted virtual training device. Trunk stabilization strapping has been part of the concept with this device, and literature is lacking to support this for long-term functional changes with individuals after stroke. The purpose of this case series was to measure the feasibility of auditory trunk sensor feedback during REO therapy, in moderate to severely impaired individuals after stroke. Case Description. Using an open label crossover comparison design, 3 chronic stroke subjects were trained for 12 sessions over six weeks on either the REO or the control condition of task related training (TRT); after a washout period of 4 weeks; the alternative therapy was given. Outcomes. With both interventions, clinically relevant improvements were found for measures of body function and structure, as well as for activity, for two participants. Providing auditory feedback during REO training for trunk control was found to be feasible. Discussion. The degree of changes evident varied per protocol and may be due to the appropriateness of the technique chosen, as well as based on patients impaired arm motor control."

    "title": "Continuous myoelectric control for powered prostheses using hidden Markov models",
    "abstract": "This paper represents an ongoing investigation of dexterous and natural control of upper extremity prostheses using the myoelectric signal. The scheme described within uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) to process four channels of myoelectric signal, with the task of discriminating six classes of limb movement. The HMM-based approach is shown to be capable of higher classification accuracy than previous methods based upon multilayer perceptrons. The method does not require segmentation of the myoelectric signal data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. The computational complexity of the HMM in its operational mode is low, making it suitable for a real-time implementation. The low computational overhead associated with training the HMM also enables the possibility of adaptive classifier training while in use."

After an initial period of wearing a cosmetic prosthesis, he was provided with a child's trans-radial myoelectric prosthesis with a Steeper Scamp Electric hand at the age of 21 months. After successful and uncomplicated use of this prosthesis for 2 years--a sudden onset of burns of the skin of the stump underlying the single electrode site was noted. The cause of the burns was thought to be due to heat generated from electrical failure possibly from ingress of moisture. This complication has not before been experienced in the authors' centre, nor has it been reported in the literature. While constant improvements are being made in the field of electrically powered prosthesis, the rehabilitation team should be aware of this unusual complication."

    "abstract": "This paper describes a concept for the extension of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) through the use of feedback of primary motor cortex activity. CIMT requires residual movement to act as a source of feedback to the patient, thus preventing its application to those with no perceptible movement. It is proposed in this paper that it is possible to provide feedback of the motor cortex effort to the patient by measurement with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Significant changes in such effort may be used to drive rehabilitative robotic actuators, for example. This may provide a possible avenue for extending CIMT to patients hitherto excluded as a result of severity of condition. In support of such a paradigm, this paper details the current status of CIMT and related attempts to extend rehabilitation therapy through the application of technology. An introduction to the relevant haemodynamics is given including a description of the basic technology behind a suitable NIRS system. An illustration of the proposed therapy is described using a simple NIRS system driving a robotic arm during simple upper-limb unilateral isometric contraction exercises with healthy subjects."

Given the severity of ICU patients' illness pain management, whilst important, may not be considered a priority and therefore can be easily overlooked. The aim of this study was to validate the Behavioural Pain Scale (BPS) for the assessment of pain in critically ill patients by evaluating facial expressions, upper limb movements and compliance with mechanical ventilation.\nMethods: A prospective, descriptive repeated measures study design was used to assess the validity and reliability of the BPS for assessing pain in critically ill patients undergoing routine painful (repositioning) and non-painful (eye care) procedures.\nResults: An average of 73% of BPS scores increased (indicating pain) after patients were repositioned, as opposed to 14% after eye care. This increase was statistically significant for repositioning (p < 0.003) but not for eye care (p > 0.3). The odds of an increase in BPS between pre- and post-procedure assessments was more than 25 times higher for repositioning compared with eye care (p < 0.0001), after controlling for analgesics and sedatives.\nConclusion: The BPS was found to be a valid and reliable tool in the assessment of pain in the unconscious sedated patient. Results also highlighted that traditional pain indicators, such as fluctuations in haemodynamic parameters, are not always an accurate measure for the assessment of pain in unconscious patients and as such more objective pain assessment measures are essential. Finally, further validation of the BPS and identification of other painful routine procedures is needed to enhance pain management delivery for unconscious patients."

Achieving this goal requires collaboration between neuroscientists, technologists and clinicians to develop well-founded systems and clinical protocols that are able to provide quantitatively validated improvements in patient rehabilitation outcomes. In this article we present three new applications of complementary technologies developed in an interdisciplinary matrix for acute-phase upper limb stroke rehabilitation - functional electrical stimulation, arm robot-assisted therapy and virtual reality-based cognitive therapy. We also outline the neuroscientific basis of our approach, present our detailed clinical assessment protocol and provide preliminary results from patient testing of each of the three systems showing their viability for patient use."

    "abstract": "This work had two goals, to study the effect of hand dominance on myoelectric signal variables and fatigue indexes in back muscles and to assess the repeatability of the estimates of such variables. Myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue were studied in the right and left longissimus dorsi muscles of five right-handed and five left-handed normal male subjects. Myoelectric signals (M waves), evoked by stimulation applied to a muscle's motor point, were detected with surface electrodes. Each test consisted of eliciting a tetanic contraction of 30 s duration with supramaximal stimulation at 25 Hz and was repeated five times on 5 different days for each subject. The mean and median frequencies of the resulting power spectra of the M waves were plotted vs. time, and fatigue indexes were obtained from the time course of these variables. Only two-thirds of the elicited contractions provided signals of sufficiently good quality to obtain reliable estimates of the mean and median frequencies. Criteria for acceptability are described. Analysis of variance and paired comparisons showed a statistically significant effect of side dominance on fatigue indexes in the right-handed subjects but not in the left-handed subjects. Normalized initial slope and other fatigue indexes based on spectral variables demonstrated myoelectric manifestations of fatigue that were greater on the dominant side. We surmise that the differences are related to the fiber type modifications associated with the unilateral usage of the upper limbs and the consequent activation of the nondominant side of the back."

The HERO Grip Glove provided 12.7 N (SD 8.9 N) of grip force and 11.0 N (SD 4.8) of pinch force to their affected hands, which enabled those without grip strength to grasp and manipulate blocks, a fork and a water bottle, as well as write with a pen. The participants were 'more or less satisfied' with the HERO Grip Glove as an assistive device (average of 3.3 out of 5 on the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology 2.0 Scale). The highest satisfaction scores were given for safety and security (4.6) and ease of use (3.8) and the lowest satisfaction scores were given for ease of donning (2.3), which required under 5 min with assistance. The most common requests were for greater grip strength and a smaller glove size for small hands.\nConclusions: The HERO Grip Glove is a safe and effective tool for enabling persons with a stroke that have severe hand impairment to incorporate their affected hand into activities of daily living, which may motivate greater use of the affected upper extremity in daily life to stimulate neuromuscular recovery."

In this paper we describe a new technique based on robot technology, with the goal of providing a reliable, accurate, quantitative evaluation of the position sense in peri-personal space. The proposed technique uses a bimanual, planar robot manipuladum (BdF device), whose handles are grasped by the blindfolded patient: the paretic hand is passively placed in one of 17 positions and the subject is asked to actively match the paretic hand position in space with the other hand. The position sense of the paretic arm and the corresponding deficit of space representation are characterized by means of 7 indicators: 1) positional error; 2) holding force; 3) medio/lateral shift; 4) antero/posterior shift; 5) medio/lateral skew; 6) antero/posterior skew; 7) shrink coefficient. We also show how the same experimental setup can be used for \"proprioceptive training\", i.e. for providing robot assistance to the paretic arm that may improve the position sense of the patient.

The specific goal of this study was to design a controller based on an artificial neural network (ANN) that extracts information from the activity of muscles that remain under voluntary control sufficient to predict appropriate stimulation levels for several paralyzed muscles in the upper extremity. The ANN was trained with activation data obtained from simulations using a musculoskeletal model of the arm that was modified to reflect C5 SCI and FES capabilities. Several arm movements were recorded from able-bodied subjects and these kinematics served as the inputs to inverse dynamic simulations that predicted muscle activation patterns corresponding to the movements recorded. A system identification procedure was used to identify an optimal reduced set of voluntary input muscles from the larger set that are typically under voluntary control in C5 SCI. These voluntary activations were used as the inputs to the ANN and muscles that are typically paralyzed in C5 SCI were the outputs to be predicted. The neural network controller was able to predict the needed FES paralyzed muscle activations from \"voluntary\" activations with less than a 3.6% RMS prediction error."

Surface EMG signals were recorded from the upper trapezius muscle of 11 healthy male subjects using a linear array of 16 surface electrodes. Five arm positions were investigated (arms at the side of the body, 45 degrees and 90 degrees flexion, 45 degrees and 90 degrees abduction). Fatiguing (1 kg hand load held for 3 min) and non-fatiguing (no load, 0.5 kg and 1 kg hand load held for 3 s) contractions were made. The variabilities of the average rectified value, root mean square, mean and median power spectral frequency and slope over time of these parameters as functions of electrode location and IED (from 5 mm over a range of 35 mm in steps of 5 mm) were quantitatively evaluated. A criterion for selecting the optimal electrode position was applied. This criterion indicated an optimal location measured from the acromion (38% of the distance from the lateral edge of acromion to the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra) which was statistically the same for all the EMG descriptors, arm positions and IED investigated. Finally, it was found that both EMG variables and indexes of muscle fatigue depended on IED which should thus be properly standardised. On the basis of the sensitivity of the EMG descriptors to electrode location and cross-talk reduction, an IED of 20 mm is suggested when a global analysis of activity in the upper trapezius muscle is made using a single pair of electrodes. This study emphasises that a surface EMG analysis of the upper trapezius muscle, following a proper placement of the electrodes and selection of IED, can give reliable indications of muscle activity and fatigue. Data on the myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue of the upper trapezius muscle are provided for the optimal electrode location."

This paper provides a critical review of current sensory systems and the potential of a selection of electroactive polymers for sensory applications in hand prostheses. Candidate electroactive polymers are reviewed in terms of their relevant advantages and disadvantages, together with their current implementation in related applications. Empirical analysis of one of the most novel electroactive polymers, ionic polymer metal composites (IPMC), was conducted to demonstrate its potential for prosthetic applications. With linear responses within the operating range typical of hand prostheses, bending angles, and bending rates were accurately measured with 4.4+/-2.5 and 4.8+/-3.5% error, respectively, using the IPMC sensors. With these comparable error rates to traditional resistive bend sensors and a wide range of sensitivities and responses, electroactive polymers offer a promising alternative to more traditional sensory approaches. Their potential role in prosthetics is further heightened by their flexible and formable structure, and their ability to act as both sensors and actuators."

Interventions involved three 45-minute sessions per week for 2 weeks, then 1 week of no treatment, and then 2 additional weeks of the alternate treatment. A therapist provided a visual cursor using a tracking device, and participants were instructed to match it with their hand. Haptic and visual EA was used with blinding of participant, therapist, technician-operator, and evaluator. Clinical measures of impairment were obtained at the beginning and end of each 2-week treatment phase as well as at 1 week and at 45 days after the last treatment.\nResults: Outcomes showed a small, but significant benefit to EA training over simple repetitive practice, with a mean 2-week improvement in Fugl-Meyer UE motor score of 2.08 and Wolf Motor Function Test of timed tasks of 1.48 s.\nConclusions: This interactive technology may improve UE motor recovery of stroke-related hemiparesis."

    "title": "Shoulder abduction-induced reductions in reaching work area following hemiparetic stroke: neuroscientific implications",
    "abstract": "A stroke-related loss of corticospinal and corticobulbar pathways is postulated to result in an increased use of remaining neural substrates such as bulbospinal pathways as individuals with stroke are required to generate greater volitional shoulder abduction torques. The effect of shoulder abduction on upper extremity reaching range of motion (work area) was measured in 18 individuals with stroke using the Arm Coordination Training 3-D (ACT(3D)) device. This robotic system is capable of quantifying movement kinematics when a subject attempts to reach while simultaneously generating various levels of active shoulder abduction torque. We have provided data demonstrating an incremental increase of abnormal coupling of elbow flexion for greater levels of shoulder abduction in the paretic limb that results in a reduction in available work area as a function of active limb support. The progressive increase in the expression of abnormal shoulder/elbow coupling can be explained by a progressive reliance on the indirect cortico-bulbospinal connections that remain in individuals following a stroke-induced brain injury."

    "title": "The Conventional Non-Articulated SACH or a Multiaxial Prosthetic Foot for Hypomobile Transtibial Amputees? A Clinical Comparison on Mobility, Balance, and Quality of Life",
    "abstract": "The effects of a non-articulated SACH and a multiaxial foot-ankle mechanism on the performance of low-activity users are of great interest for practitioners in amputee rehabilitation. The aim of this study is to compare these two prosthetic feet and assess possible improvements introduced by the increased degrees of freedom provided by the multiaxial foot. For this purpose, a group of 20 hypomobile transtibial amputees (TTAs) had their usual SACH replaced with a multiaxial foot. Participants' functional mobility, involving ambulatory skills in overground level walking, ramps, and stairs, was evaluated by performing Six-Minute Walking Test (6 MWT), Locomotor Capability Index-5 (LCI-5), Hill Assessment Index (HAI), and Stair Assessment Index (SAI). Balance performances were assessed using Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and analysing upper body accelerations during gait. Moreover, the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) was performed to indicate the prosthesis-related quality of life. Results showed that participants walked faster using the multiaxial foot (p < 0.05) maintaining the same upright gait stability. Significant improvements with the multiaxial foot were also observed in BBS, LCI-5, and SAI times and 4 of 9 subscales of the PEQ. Our findings demonstrate that a multiaxial foot represents a considerable alternative solution with respect to the conventional SACH in the prosthetic prescription for hypomobile TTAs."

    "abstract": "The effect of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms on limb myoblast migration was examined in vitro. Using Blindwell Chemotaxis chambers, the ability of PDGF-AA, -AB and -BB to stimulate the migration of myoblasts, obtained from the proximal region of 11.5 day mouse forelimb buds, was examined. Immunocytochemistry, with the anti-sarcomeric myosin antibody MF-20, was used to identify the myogenic cells in the heterogeneous cell population. Myoblasts, suspended in PDGF-free medium in the upper chamber, migrated across the polycarbonate filter of the Blindwell chamber to 1-10 ng/ml PDGF-AB and 1-100 ng/ml PDGF-BB situated in the lower well. At 1-10 ng/ml of either PDGF-AB or -BB migration increased in a dose-dependent manner. PDGF-AA, however, was unable to elicit a significant locomotory response in forelimb myoblasts. A Checkerboard assay, with various concentrations of PDGF-AA, -AB or -BB in the upper and lower wells of the chamber, indicated that -AB and -BB but not -AA stimulated the random migration of limb myoblasts. The differential effect of PDGF isoforms on myoblast migration was compared with other aspects of skeletal muscle development. At 0.1-10 ng/ml all three isoforms were able to stimulate an increase in the number of differentiated myoblasts, indicated by the expression of sarcomeric myosin, on examination after 48 h when cultured at low density. In high density cultures, however, these isoforms inhibited myoblast fusion when compared to the spontaneous fusion observed in untreated cultures. Immunohistochemical studies of both cultured limb cells and cryosections of 11.5 day whole limbs revealed that myoblasts expressed both PDGF alpha- and beta-receptors which suggests that the action of PDGF isoforms on limb myoblasts is receptor-mediated. Finally, having demonstrated that the PDGF-B monomer stimulates migration in limb myoblasts, by immunohistochemistry, the presence of PDGF-B was confirmed and its distribution examined in the 11.5 day forelimb."

    "abstract": "Five patients with respiratory dependent rate responsive pacemakers (Biorate RDP3, Biotec) were studied using ambulatory telemetry to evaluate the sensitivity of this pacing system to nonrespiratory signals. In each case the pacemaker was implanted in the left infraclavicular position with an impedance sensing electrode inserted into the subcutaneous tissues of the anterior chest wall. The pacing rate was 73 +/- 2 beats per minute at rest and rose by 42 +/- 5 beats per minute when the patients were walking with both arms swinging (mean +/- SEM). Three of the five patients had sensing electrodes that extended across the midline. In this subgroup, pacing rate rose by 26 +/- 4 beats per minute when walking with arms held immobile and by 36 +/- 2 beats per minute during sustained voluntary hyperventilation. These same activities did not elicit any appreciable changes in pacing rate in the remaining two patients whose sensing electrodes were confined to the left hemithorax. Recordings taken from all five patients while they were standing upright and regularly swinging one upper limb showed an increase in pacing rate of 15 + 6 beats per minute with movement of the right arm and 46 + 8 with movement of the left. These observations establish that the Biorate RDP3 pacemaker is capable of responding both to changes in respiratory rate and to movement of the upper limbs. The sensitivity to limb movement is greatest when the chest wall impedance sensor does not extend across the midline and is most evident when the arm ipsilateral to the pacemaker is swung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "title": "The effect of head position, electrode site, movement and smoothing window in the determination of a reliable maximum voluntary activation of the upper trapezius muscle",
    "abstract": "Quantitative measures derived from raw myoelectric signal (MES) data must be normalized to allow for comparisons both within and between subjects. The most common method of normalization involves dividing the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the MES recorded during a given activity by the RMS of the MES elicited during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of that particular muscle. The objective of this study was to use surface-recorded MES amplitude to determine the combination of electrode site, test position, head posture, and smoothing window that elicits the highest and most reliable MES amplitudes during an MVIC of the upper trapezius (UT) muscle. Ten volunteers had surface electrodes positioned at five sites on the UT of their dominant side. Three trials of each of three MVIC test positions were performed both with the head in neutral and rotated 45 degrees to the contralateral side. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used for statistical hypothesis testing. Coefficients of variation were used to quantify the between-factor variability introduced in each case. In addition, the data were re-analyzed using moving windows of 100 to 500 ms in length, and an ANOVA was used to determine the effect of window length on both the amplitude and variability of the estimates of maximum voluntary activation (MVE). Head position had no significant effect on RMS amplitude of the MVIC in any of the test positions. There was a significant electrode site by test position interaction effect. Bonferroni post-hoc analyses were performed on this interaction by fixing test position and testing electrode site, revealing that Sites 1 (2 cm lateral to the midpoint between C7 spinous process and the posterolateral border of the acromion) and 4 (2 cm posterior to Site 1) recorded significantly higher RMS values for all test positions, and were not significantly different from each other. Fixing electrode site, the test position analysis revealed that abduction of the humerus, and abduction with external rotation of the humerus produced significantly higher RMS values than shoulder elevation at both Sites 1 and 4, and that abduction produced a significantly higher RMS amplitude than abduction in external rotation at Site 1. The results confirmed that Sites 1 and 4 consistently produced the highest MES amplitudes for all movements. Pure abduction consistently elicited maximal RMS values; however there is concern regarding supraspinatus cross talk during this movement. Site 1 was found to produce the most reliable data. A moving window of 100 ms was found to generate MVE estimates that were significantly higher than windows ranging from 200 ms to 500 ms in length. There was no effect of window length on the reliability of the MVEs. Based on this study, it was concluded that abduction or abduction with the arms in lateral rotation should be used as normalization contraction positions for the upper trapezius muscle. During this movement, Site 1 data smoothed with a moving window of 100 ms produces the highest amplitude MVE data but window lengths greater than 200 ms produce more stable estimates in terms of being able to compare studies in which moving windows are used to compute RMS."

    "abstract": "This paper describes a real-time system for separation among several limb functions, in order to provide multifunctional control of an upper-limb prosthesis for above-elbow amputees. The system employs microprocessor hardware and is based on identification of voluntary myoelectric signals resulting from isometric contractions of the musculature of the residual limb, and on subsequent discrimination of these signals for control of the several degrees of motion of the prosthesis. The system requires only one to two electrode sites. (Contrary to the usual placement of electrode pairs directly over specific muscle bellies, to eliminate crosstalk, we prefer to place our electrode pair between muscles so as to acquire the different weakly-correlated signals associated with each of several different voluntary functions). The system satisfies the various practical constraints of weight, volume, and speed, as arise in practical prostheses. Preliminary amputee tests on the system have resulted in an 85 percent success rate using 8-bit double-precision micro-computer hardware."

    "abstract": "Individuals with a C5/C6 spinal-cord injury (SCI) have paralyzed elbow extensors, yet retain weak to strong voluntary control of elbow flexion and some shoulder movements. They lack elbow extension, which is critical during activities of daily living. This research focuses on the functional evaluation of a developed synergistic controller employing remaining voluntary elbow flexor and shoulder electromyography (EMG) to control elbow extension with functional electrical stimulation (FES). Remaining voluntarily controlled upper extremity muscles were used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to control stimulation of the paralyzed triceps. Surface EMG was collected from SCI subjects while they produced isometric endpoint force vectors of varying magnitude and direction using triceps stimulation levels predicted by a biomechanical model. ANNs were trained with the collected EMG and stimulation levels. We hypothesized that once trained and implemented in real-time, the synergistic controller would provide several functional benefits. We anticipated the synergistic controller would provide a larger range of endpoint force vectors, the ability to grade and maintain forces, the ability to complete a functional overhead reach task, and use less overall stimulation than a constant stimulation scheme."

    "title": "Predicting targets of human reaching motions using different sensing technologies",
    "abstract": "Rapid recognition of voluntary motions is crucial in human-computer interaction, but few studies compare the predictive abilities of different sensing technologies. This paper thus compares performances of different technologies when predicting targets of human reaching motions: electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography, camera-based eye tracking, electromyography (EMG), hand position, and the user's preferences. Supervised machine learning is used to make predictions at different points in time (before and during limb motion) with each individual sensing modality. Different modalities are then combined using an algorithm that takes into account the different times at which modalities provide useful information. Results show that EEG can make predictions before limb motion onset, but requires subject-specific training and exhibits decreased performance as the number of possible targets increases. EMG and hand position give high accuracy, but only once the motion has begun. Eye tracking is robust and exhibits high accuracy at the very onset of limb motion. Several advantages of combining different modalities are also shown, including advantages of combining measurements with contextual data. Finally, some recommendations are given for sensing modalities with regard to different criteria and applications. The information could aid human-computer interaction designers in selecting and evaluating appropriate equipment for their applications."

    "title": "Wearable Dual-Frequency Vibrotactile System for Restoring Force and Stiffness Perception",
    "abstract": "Recently, there has been substantial progress in the mechatronic design and myoelectric control of active prostheses. However, a significant unmet need is the lack of sensory feedback in commercial prostheses for upper-limb amputees. The lack of sensory perception impacts on the control performance and embodiment, determining relatively high rejection rates. Previous research has been conducted to evaluate various non-invasive substitutional sensory channels, mainly to regenerate haptic perception. However, providing sensory channels for stiffness perception has been much less explored. In this short paper, we propose a non-invasive wearable sensory armband, named vibrotactile frequency modulation (V-FM) system. Using the V-FM, we implement a closed-loop myocontrol system with force and stiffness perception. A user study was conducted based on a repetitive two-forced alternative choice discrimination test in six able-bodied participants. The study was designed according to the method of constant stimuli. Results showed that using the V-FM armband, the participants recovered sensation comparable (in terms of difference threshold) to the natural stiffness perception. This demonstrated the potential of the proposed V-FM armband in restoring haptic and stiffness perception non-invasively."

    "abstract": "The surface electromyographic (SEMG) signal is very convenient for prosthesis control because it is non-invasively acquired and intrinsically related to the user's intention. This work presents a feature extraction and pattern classification algorithm for estimation of the intended knee joint angle from SEMG signals acquired using two sets of electrodes placed on the upper leg. The proposed algorithm uses a combination of time-domain and frequency-domain approaches for feature extraction (signal amplitude histogram and auto-regressive coefficients, respectively), a self-organizing map for feature projection and a Levenberg-Marquardt multi-layer perceptron neural network for pattern classification. The new algorithm was quantitatively compared with the method proposed by Wang et al (2006 Med. Biol. Eng. Comput. 44 865-72), which uses wavelet packet feature extraction, principal component analysis and a multi-layer perceptron neural classifier. The proposed method provided lower error-to-signal percentage and peak error amplitudes, higher correlation and fewer error events. The algorithm presented in this work may be useful as part of a myoelectric controller for active leg prostheses designed for transfemoral amputees."

    "abstract": "Reimplantation is a well-established procedure in reconstructive surgery. This is especially so after amputation of the upper limb since prostheses provide limited function. In unilateral amputation of the lower leg orthotopic reimplantation is the treatment of choice. With bilateral amputation, in which orthotopic reimplantation is not possible because of the complexity of the trauma, heterotopic reimplantation is an option. We report five patients who received orthotopic and two who received heterotopic reimplantations of the lower leg. We assessed the functional outcomewith reference to cutaneous sensation, mobility, pain, and the cosmetic result. The functional outcome was good, as was the patients' satisfaction. Their mobility, stability, and psychological state were satisfactory. Patients with heterotopic reimplantations preferred the reimplanted leg to a prosthesis. Although reimplantation of the lower leg requires prolonged hospitalisation, delayed mobilisation and secondary operations, we conclude that there is an indication for this operation in order to improve the patient's quality of life."

    "abstract": "Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals have often been used in estimating upper and lower limb dynamics and kinematics for the purpose of controlling robotic devices such as robot prosthesis and finger exoskeletons. However, in estimating multiple and a high number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF) kinematics from EMG, output DOFs are usually estimated independently. In this study, we estimate finger joint kinematics from EMG signals using a multi-output convolved Gaussian Process (Multi-output Full GP) that considers dependencies between outputs. We show that estimation of finger joints from muscle activation inputs can be improved by using a regression model that considers inherent coupling or correlation within the hand and finger joints. We also provide a comparison of estimation performance between different regression methods, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) which is used by many of the related studies. We show that using a multi-output GP gives improved estimation compared to multi-output ANN and even dedicated or independent regression models."

    "abstract": "We describe a wearable orthosis and an associated algorithm for the simultaneous assessment and treatment of essential tremor, one of the most common movement disorders in humans involving an overactivity of the olivo-cerebellar pathways. A motor providing effective viscosity is fixed on a wearable orthosis in the upper limbs. The motor is controlled by a personal computer with software processing in real time the position and rate of rotation of the joint detected by a chip gyroscope. The orthosis can be used in a monitoring mode and in an active mode. The range of tremor suppression of the signals above the orthosis operational limit ranges from about 3% (percentile 5) to about 79% (percentile 95) in relation to energy in the monitoring mode. Considering both postural and kinetic, the mean tremor energy decreased from 55.49 +/- 22.93 rad2 s(-3) in the monitoring mode to 15.66 +/- 7.29 rad2 s(-3) in the active mode. Medians of power reduction were below 60% for the wrist and the elbow. In addition to supplying new information on the interactions between kinematics, dynamics and tremor genesis, this non-invasive technique is an alternative to current therapies. This new approach will provide new insights into the understanding of motor control."

The system is based on a low cost/power/size smart architecture of off-the-shelf miniaturized vibration motors; the main novelty is that it is able to generate stimuli where both vibration amplitude and frequency as well as beat interference can be modulated. This paper is aimed at evaluating this system by investigating the capability of healthy volunteers to perceive-on their forearms-vibrations with different amplitudes and/or frequencies. In addition, the ability of subjects in spatially discriminating stimulations on three forearm sites and recognizing six different combinations of stimulations was also addressed. Results demonstrate that subjects were able to discriminate different force amplitudes exerted by the device (accuracies greater than 75%); when both amplitude and frequency were simultaneously varied, the pure discrimination of amplitude/frequency variation was affected by the variation of the other. Subjects were also able to discriminate with an accuracy of 93% three different sites and with an accuracy of 78% six different stimulation patterns."

Standardized mechanical taps were delivered to an implant, a denture tooth, or a natural tooth in the central incisor region of the maxilla. Bilateral surface electromyographic recordings of the masseter muscles were obtained while subjects maintained a constant myoelectric activity by clenching. Stimulation of an implant in partially edentulous subjects elicited a reflex response in 7 of 10 subjects. Likewise, stimulation of a tooth of a maxillary removable denture resulted in a clear reflex response in 5 of 10 totally edentulous subjects. On the other hand, a reflex response did only occur in 1 of 10 totally edentulous subjects with implant-supported prostheses in both jaws. It was concluded that the presence of some natural teeth in either the maxilla or mandible allowed the occurrence of a reflex response. In totally edentulous subjects, mucosal or periosteal mechanoreceptors, triggered by stimulation of the denture bearing area or by transmission of vibrations through the jaw bone, could be responsible for the remaining reflex responses."

Most previous efforts concentrated on evaluating the performance of EMG pattern-recognition algorithms in identifying one signal movement at a time. Therefore, the current motion classification methods would be limited with the difficulties in identifying the combined upper-limb motion classes that are commonly required in performing activities daily. In this paper, four improved classifier training schemes were proposed and investigated to address the difficulties mentioned above. Our preliminary results showed that three of the four proposed training schemes could improve the classification performance. The average classification accuracies of the three methods were 75.10% ± 9.71%, 76.95% ± 8.02%, and 77.56% ± 6.55% for the able-bodied subjects, and 63.38% ± 7.51%, 62.55% ± 9.06%, and 62.50% ± 9.36% for the transradial amputees, respectively. These results suggested that the proposed methods could provide better classification performance in identifying the combined motions than the current methods."

    "title": "Control of a pneumatic orthosis for upper extremity stroke rehabilitation",
    "abstract": "A key challenge in rehabilitation robotics is the development of a lightweight, large force, high degrees-of-freedom device that can assist in functional rehabilitation of the arm. Pneumatic actuators can potentially help meet this challenge because of their high power-to-weight ratio. They are currently not widely used for rehabilitation robotics because they are difficult to control. This paper describes the control development of a pneumatically actuated, upper extremity orthosis for rehabilitation after stroke. To provide the sensing needed for good pneumatic control, position and velocity of the robot are estimated by a unique implementation of a Kalman filter using MEMS accelerometers. To compensate for the nonlinear behavior of the pneumatic servovalves, force control is achieved using a new method for air flow mapping using experimentally measured data in a least-squares regression. To help patients move with an inherently compliant robot, a high level controller that assists only as needed in reaching exercises is developed. This high level controller differs from traditional trajectory-based, position controllers, allowing free voluntary movements toward a target while resisting movements away from the target. When the target cannot be reached voluntarily, the controller slowly builds up force, pushing the arm toward the target. As each target position is reached, the controller builds an internal model of the subject's capability, learning the forces necessary to complete movements. Preliminary testing performed on a non-disabled subject demonstrated the ability of the orthosis to complete reaching movements with graded assistance and to adapt to the effort level of the subject. Thus, the orthosis is a promising tool for upper extremity rehabilitation after stroke."

Three experienced neuroprosthesis users were evaluated with each of the control methods by performing a grasp release test (GRT). A significant improvement was found between each functional electrical stimulation (FES) method and tenodesis without FES. No significant difference in overall performance was found between the three FES methods of control. Each method of control demonstrated advantages and disadvantages which depend upon characteristics of the individual patient. Factors which must be considered are injury level, voluntary wrist strength, proximal upper limb strength, the level of cognition of the patient, hand-grasp characteristics, cosmeses, importance of using both arms, and personal preference. Due to the unique characteristics of each controller type, it is advantageous to have each type available for the FES patients to adapt the system to the needs and desires of the individual patient."

A haptic robot was programmed according to a strategy of minimal, progressively reduced assistance, with a double representation of targets: (i) visual (circles on a screen) and (ii) haptic (robot-generated force fields). The protocol included trials with and without vision, in order to emphasize the role of proprioceptive feedback. The training paradigm included 10 sessions and more than 5000 movements.\nSubjects: Ten chronic, hemiparetic subjects; four controls provided reference values for the performance measurements.\nOutcome measures: Four performance indicators (derived from the analysis of the reaching trajectories); clinical/functional measures (Fugl-Meyer and Ashworth scales).\nResults: After robot therapy reaching movements became faster and smoother. The performance in the no-vision trials was at least as good as in the vision trials. The Fugl-Meyer arm scores also increased significantly and remained approximately constant at follow-up; the Ashworth scores did not change.\nConclusion: In spite of its simplicity, a limited number of ;gentle' robot therapy sessions appear to be beneficial, even for severely impaired patients, although no firm conclusion can be drawn at this point. However, the study provides support material for the careful design of controlled clinical trials and for a better integration with physiotherapy."

Our approach focuses on how robotic interaction can impact the distribution of movements expressed in the arm. Using data from a previous study with stroke survivors (n=10), we performed simulations to examine how changes in hand endpoint impedance would alter exploratory motion. We present methods for designing a custom training intervention, by relating the desired change in acceleration covariance in planar motion with a corresponding change in inertia matrix. We first characterized motor exploration in terms of overall covariance in acceleration, and secondly as covariance that varies with position in the workspace. Using a forward dynamics simulation of the hand endpoint impedance, we found that the variable change in endpoint inertia resulted in better recovery of acceleration covariance compared to the fixed change in inertia method. These results could significantly impact rehabilitation firstly in terms of design principles for altering coordination patterns through direct assistance. Furthermore, our work might serve to improve therapy by facilitating access to repeated practice of independent joint motion."

By identifying repeatable patterns of muscle activity across multiple muscle sites rather than relying on independent EMG signals it is possible to provide more natural, reliable control of myoelectric prostheses. The purposes of this study were to (1) determine if participants can perform distinctive muscle activation patterns associated with multiple wrist and hand movements reliably and (2) to show that high density EMG can be applied individually to determine the electrode location of a clinically acceptable number of electrodes (maximally eight) to classify multiple wrist and hand movements reliably in transradial amputees. Eight normally limbed subjects (five female, three male) and four transradial amputee subjects (two traumatic and congenital) subjects participated in this study, which examined the classification accuracies of a pattern recognition control system. It was found that tasks could be classified with high accuracy (85-98%) with normally limbed subjects (10-13 tasks) and with amputees (4-6) tasks. In healthy subjects, reducing the number of electrodes to eight did not affect accuracy significantly when those electrodes were optimally placed, but did reduce accuracy significantly when those electrodes were distributed evenly. In the amputee subjects, reducing the number of electrodes up to 4 did not affect classification accuracy or the number of tasks with high accuracy, independent of whether those remaining electrodes were evenly distributed or optimally placed. The findings in healthy subjects suggest that high density EMG testing is a useful tool to identify optimal electrode sites for pattern recognition control, but its use in amputees still has to be proven. Instead of just identifying the electrode sites where EMG activity is strong, clinicians will be able to choose the electrode sites that provide the most important information for classification."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine how multijoint stretch reflexes are modulated during interactions with stiff and compliant environments. Reflex responses were elicited using a 3D robotic manipulator to perturb arm posture in the three degrees of freedom relevant to functional behaviors. The robot applied controlled displacements and simulated environments with different stiffnesses. Stiff (10 kN/m) and compliant (10 N/m) environments were used. Perturbation characteristics were matched across environments. Reflex responses were monitored using surface electromyograms from 8 upper limb muscles. Data were collected from 9 subjects. Significant stretch reflex responses were observed in all muscles and these were significantly modulated by the environmental stiffness. This modulation was due to increased levels of background muscle activity in the compliant environment and to increased reflex sensitivity at matched levels of muscle activation. These results suggest that the neuromotor control system uses both feedforward and feedback mechanisms to compensate for changes in environmental compliance."

Neural injuries, such as stroke, might negatively affect such an awareness and, consequently, lead to degrading the quality of life and lengthening the motor recovery process. With the goal of improving the sense of hand position in three-dimensional (3D) space, we investigate the effects of integrating a pertinent training component within a robotic reaching task.\nMethods: In the proof-of-concept study presented in this paper, 12 healthy participants, during a single session, used their dominant hand to attempt reaching without vision to two targets in 3D space, which were placed at locations that resembled the functional task of self-feeding. After each attempt, participants received visual and haptic feedback about their hand's position to accurately locate the target. Performance was evaluated at the beginning and end of each session during an assessment in which participants reached without visual nor haptic feedback to three targets: the same two targets employed during the training phase and an additional one to evaluate the generalization of training.\nResults: Collected data showed a statistically significant [39.81% (p=0.001)] reduction of end-position reaching error when results of reaching to all targets were combined. End-position error to the generalization target, although not statistically significant, was reduced by 15.47%.\nConclusions: These results provide support for the effectiveness of combining an arm position sense training component with functional motor tasks, which could be implemented in the design of future robot-assisted rehabilitation paradigms to potentially expedite the recovery process of individuals with neurological injuries."

    "abstract": "Recently, bilateral movement training based on robot-assisted rehabilitation systems has been attracting a lot of attention as a post-stroke motor rehabilitation protocol. Since humans generate coordinated motions based on their motor and sensory systems, investigation of the innate properties of human motor or sensory systems may provide insight into planning of effective bilateral movement training. In this study, we investigate the effects of proprioception and handedness on the movement of the contra-lateral upper limb, under both active and passive guidance conditions of the robot manipulators. Active and passive guidance-reproduction based bimanual tasks were used in this study; in these the subject is asked to hold both the right and left knobs installed at the end-effectors of two robot manipulators. The results indicate that better reproducing performance was obtained when the proprioceptive input was acquired from the active guidance condition."

    "title": "Congenital hypomyelination neuropathy in a newborn infant: unusual cause of diaphragmatic and vocal cord paralyses",
    "abstract": "We report a case of congenital hypomyelination neuropathy presenting at birth. The infant had generalized hypotonia and weakness. There was decreased respiratory effort along with a right phrenic nerve and left vocal cord paralyses. Tongue fasciculations were present. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in the upper extremities and hypoactive (1+) in the lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed no intracranial abnormalities, including normal cerebral myelination. Nerve conduction study showed absence of motor and sensory action potentials in the hands when the nerves in the upper limbs were stimulated. A motor response could be elicited only in the proximal leg muscles. Needle electromyography study was normal in the proximal limb muscles, but showed active denervation in the distal muscles of the arm and leg. These findings were thought to be consistent with a length-dependent sensorimotor peripheral polyneuropathy of axonal type with greater denervation of the distal muscles. A biopsy of the quadriceps muscle showed mild variability in fiber diameter, but no group typing or group atrophy. The muscle fibers showed no intrinsic abnormalities. Biopsy of the sural nerve showed scattered axons with very thin myelin sheaths. There was also a nearly complete loss of large diameter myelinated fibers. No onion bulb formations were noted. These findings were thought to be consistent with congenital hypomyelination neuropathy with a component of axonopathy. DNA analysis for identification of previously characterized mutations in the genes MPZ, PMP22, and EGR2 was negative. Several attempts at extubation failed and the infant became increasingly ventilator-dependent with increasing episodes of desaturation and hypercapnea. He also developed increasing weakness and decreased movement of all extremities. He underwent surgery at 2 months of age for placement of a gastrostomy tube and a tracheostomy. He was discharged from the hospital on a ventilator at 6 months of age. The infant was 13 months old at the time of submission of this report. Although he appears cognitively normal, he remains profoundly hypotonic and is on a home ventilator. There was no evidence of progressive weakness. Congenital hypomyelination neuropathy is a rare form of neonatal neuropathy that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a newborn with profound hypotonia and weakness. It appears to be a heterogeneous disorder with some of the cases being caused by specific genetic mutations."

    "title": "A robust, real-time control scheme for multifunction myoelectric control",
    "abstract": "This paper represents an ongoing investigation of dexterous and natural control of upper extremity prostheses using the myoelectric signal (MES). The scheme described within uses pattern recognition to process four channels of MES, with the task of discriminating multiple classes of limb movement. The method does not require segmentation of the MES data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. It is shown in this paper that, by exploiting the processing power inherent in current computing systems, substantial gains in classifier accuracy and response time are possible. Other important characteristics for prosthetic control systems are met as well. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. Finally, minimal storage capacity is required, which is an important factor in embedded control systems."

Benefits of this system include flexibility to conduct a variety of dissimilar tasks and reality of user feedback in physical space. Two separate experiments validated the teleoperated robotic system. The first experiment tested unimanual human motor control and the second tested bimanual motor control. This teleoperated robotic system can be used as an assessment device to study neuromuscular adaptability via a variety of control strategies providing a new and functional approach to human motor control analysis."

    "abstract": "Six patients with insufficient soft-tissue coverage after lower limb trauma were treated with pedicled fillet of foot flaps to achieve primary stump closure and to preserve leg length. The flaps used were all based on either the posterior tibial neurovascular pedicle, the anterior tibial neurovascular pedicle, or both. Five flaps survived; one patient required conversion of a through-knee to an above-knee amputation and debridement of the flap because of venous thrombosis of the pedicle. In three of the cases, a functional knee joint was preserved. The patients ranged in age from 21 to 54 years, the mean hospital stay was 55.5 days (range, 28 to 76 days), and the mean follow-up time was 14.5 months. Despite an average of 4.3 procedures from initial admission to first discharge and an average of 2.0 postamputation procedures to achieve primary stump healing, all patients have achieved independent mobility with their prosthesis. The advantages of preserving leg length and, where possible, preserving a functional knee joint compensate for repeated procedures on these patients. When planned well, a pedicled fillet of foot flap therefore achieves the aims of amputation, namely, providing primary healing of a sensate, durable, cylindrical stump that is pain-free and preserves maximal leg length. This is achieved with no donor-site morbidity and with no need for microvascular reconstruction."

Identification procedures are described to estimate the unknown parameters using tests that can be performed in a short period of time. Examples of identified parameters obtained experimentally are presented for both stroke patients and unimpaired subjects. A discussion concerning the identification's repeatability, together with results confirming the accuracy of the overall representation, is given. The model has been used during clinical trials in which electrical stimulation is applied to the triceps muscle of a number of stroke patients for the purpose of improving both their performance at reaching tasks and their level of voluntary control over their impaired arm. Its purpose in this context is threefold: Firstly, changes occurring in the levels of stiffness and spasticity in each subject's arm can be monitored by comparing frictional components of models identified at different times during treatment. Secondly, the model is used to calculate the moments applied during tracking tasks that are due to a patient's voluntary effort, and it therefore constitutes a useful tool with which to analyze their performance. Thirdly, the model is used to derive the advanced controllers that govern the level of stimulation applied to subjects over the course of the treatment. Details are provided to show how the model is applied in each case, and sample results are shown."

Massed practice combined with error augmentation, where haptic (robotic forces) and graphic (visual display) distortions are used to enhance the feedback of error, was compared to massed practice alone. The 6-week randomized crossover design involved approximately 60 minutes of daily treatment three times per week for two weeks, followed by one week of rest, and then repeated using the alternate treatment protocol. A therapist provided a visual target using a tracking device that moved a cursor in front of the patient, who was instructed to maintain the cursor on the target. The patient, therapist, technician-operator, and rater were blinded to treatment type. Several clinical measures gauged outcomes at the beginning and end of each 2-week period and one week post training. Results showed incremental benefit across most but not all days, abrupt gains in performance, and a benefit to error augmentation training in final evaluations. This application of interactive technology may be a compelling new method for enhancing a therapist's productivity in stroke-rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "Background: Current clinical myoelectric systems provide unnatural prosthesis control, with limited functionality. In this study, we propose a proportional state-based control method, which allows switching between functions in a more natural and intuitive way than the traditional co-contraction switch method.\nMethods: We validated the ability of the proposed system to provide precise control in both position and velocity modes. Two tests were performed with online visual feedback, involving target reaching and direct force control in grasping. The performance of the system was evaluated both on a subject with limb deficiency and in 9 intact-limbed subjects, controlling two degrees of freedom (DoF) of the hand and wrist.\nResults: The system allowed completion of the tasks involving 1-DoF with task completion rate >96% and of those involving 2-DoF with completion rate >91%. When compared with the clinical/industrial state-of-the-art approach and with a classic pattern recognition approach, the proposed method significantly improved the performance in the 2-DoF tasks. The completion rate in grasping force control was >97% on average.\nConclusions: These results indicate that, using the proposed system, subjects were successfully able to operate two DoFs, and to achieve precise force control in grasping. Thus, the proposed state-based method could be a suitable alternative for commercial myoelectric devices, providing reliable and intuitive control of two DoFs."

    "abstract": "Exoskeleton robots are promising assistive/rehabilitative devices that can help people with force deficits or allow the recovery of patients who have suffered from pathologies such as stroke. The key component that allows the user to control the exoskeleton is the human machine interface (HMI). Setting the HMI at the neuro-muscular level may lead to seamless integration and intuitive control of the exoskeleton arm as a natural extension of the human body. At the core of the exoskeleton HMI there is a model of the human muscle, the \"myoprocessor,\" running in real-time and in parallel to the physiological muscle, that predicts joint torques as a function of the joint kinematics and neural activation levels. This paper presents the development of myoprocessors for the upper limb based on the Hill phenomenological muscle model. Genetic algorithms are used to optimize the internal parameters of the myoprocessors utilizing an experimental database that provides inputs to the model and allows for performance assessment. The results indicate high correlation between joint moment predictions of the model and the measured data. Consequently, the myoprocessor seems an adequate model, sufficiently robust for further integration into the exoskeleton control system."

The purpose of this study was to verify that EPP control, implemented by coupling prosthesis function to residual shoulder motion in a position-servo relationship, could be effectively applied in multifunctional prostheses for shoulder disarticulation amputees. Although Simpson has shown that the principle works, the authors wanted to quantify its effectiveness and analyze its limitations. Studies were performed analyzing the feasibility of using shoulder elevation-depression and protraction-retraction as prosthesis control inputs. The results of this study showed that a prosthesis mechanism with nonlimiting dynamic response characteristics and shoulder-activated EPP control of wrist rotation and elbow flexion/extension, exhibited functional characteristics comparable to those of the physiological elbow and wrist as defined by tracking capabilities. The results of this investigation also showed that shoulder-effected position control of prosthesis function has considerably more potential for providing effective control than similarly effected velocity control."

    "abstract": "This study investigated the relationship between movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) and motor unit (MU) activity during muscle contractions. Ten right-handed, healthy males performed three motor tasks which were designed to bring about three different MU recruitment patterns while eliciting identical terminal force levels. In task I, the subjects were asked to perform 'shots' of self-paced isometric elbow flexion at 20% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). In task II, subjects performed 'holds' and maintained a constant isometric contraction for 2 s. In task III, task II was again performed while circulation was occluded prior to and during the trials. The arterial occlusion was induced by a pressure cuff around the upper-arm which was inflated to 200 mmHg for 5 min before the trials. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded from scalp electrodes 2 s before and 2 s after the initiation of the motor tasks. The myoelectric (EMG) signals from the biceps brachii were recorded together with the force measurement. These simultaneously recorded EEG, EMG and force data were time-locked to the onset of force (1% of the target force) by an on-line computer system and then averaged for 50 trials for each subject. Grand average data indicated that there were no significant differences in the grand mean force levels exerted among the three tasks. The averaged EMG amplitude during force output in task III, however, was significantly (P < 0.001) greater than those in task II. The significantly greater EMG amplitude on the identical force output that was observed may thus be due to progressive recruitment of additional MU to compensate for the deficit in force development during trials with arterial occlusion. The averaged mean MRCP amplitudes after the onset of movement (AM potentials) were significantly (P < 0.001) greater in order of tasks III, II and I at all electrode locations (C3, Cz, C4). Our data suggest that the mean amplitude of AM potentials was related to MU activity, i.e., the higher the negativity of AM potentials, the greater the MU activity."

    "title": "Bayesian State Estimation in Sensorimotor Systems With Particle Filtering",
    "abstract": "In sensorimotor control, sensory feedback integrates with forward models to alleviate the impacts of sensory noise and delay on state estimation. The sensorimotor integration is subject to Bayesian inference and has been formulated by the Kalman filter in computational neuroscience. However, the Kalman filter, as an artificial optimal estimator to address the abstract characteristics of spatial perception, is inadequate to present the neural computation in the cerebellum. Besides, the nonlinear neuromuscular dynamics with tightly coupled state variables also substantially impedes the implementation of Kalman filter in realistic sensorimotor systems. Here we address the sensorimotor state estimate by using the particle filter, a nonlinear Bayesian estimator that can be implemented in arbitrary dynamic systems with the neurocomputational compatibility. Particle filtering is explicitly implemented in a biophysically realistic sensorimotor model of an upper limb integrating Hill-type muscles, tendons, skeleton, and primary afferents. By involving the command noises, the constructed neuromusculoskeletal model qualitatively represents the experimental variability in center-out reaching movements. Despite the initial estimation uncertainty and sensorimotor noises, the particle filter is able to approximate the actual states in forward-reaching movements. Furthermore, the simulated hand-position estimate is consistent with the experimental results, in the presence of forward model errors, neural noises, and sensory delays. The particle filter is demonstrated to effectively implement the Bayesian state estimation in biophysically realistic sensorimotor systems and provide better compatibility with neuronal computation than the Kalman filter."

Initial analysis of features under different actions was performed and movement recognition of detected samples was attempted. Singular value decomposition features (SVD) extracted from wavelet coefficients were used as inputs for neural network classifier to predict amputee's movement intentions. The whole training rate was up to 80.94% and the test rate was 56.87% without over-training. This result gives inspiring prospect that collective signals from fascicules of the three main nerves are feasible sources for controlling prosthesis. Ways for improving accuracy in developing prosthesis controlled by neuro signals are discussed in the end."

Though the sEMG signals have a lot of information about the activities of the muscles, the signals do not have the activities of the deep layer muscles. We focused on forearm deformation, since hand motion brings the muscles, tendons, and skeletons under the skin. The reason why we focus is that we believe the forearm deformation delivers information about the activities of deep layer muscles. In this paper, we propose a hand motion recognition method based on the forearm deformation measured with a distance sensor array. The method uses the support vector machine. Our method achieved a mean accuracy of 92.6% for seven hand motions. Because the accuracy of the pronation and the supination are high, the distance sensor array has the potential to estimate the activities of deep layer muscles."

    "abstract": "Objective: Decoding forelimb movements from the firing activity of cortical neurons has been interfaced with robotic and prosthetic systems to replace lost upper limb functions in humans. Despite the potential of this approach to improve locomotion and facilitate gait rehabilitation, decoding lower limb movement from the motor cortex has received comparatively little attention. Here, we performed experiments to identify the type and amount of information that can be decoded from neuronal ensemble activity in the hindlimb area of the rat motor cortex during bipedal locomotor tasks.\nApproach: Rats were trained to stand, step on a treadmill, walk overground and climb staircases in a bipedal posture. To impose this gait, the rats were secured in a robotic interface that provided support against the direction of gravity and in the mediolateral direction, but behaved transparently in the forward direction. After completion of training, rats were chronically implanted with a micro-wire array spanning the left hindlimb motor cortex to record single and multi-unit activity, and bipolar electrodes into 10 muscles of the right hindlimb to monitor electromyographic signals. Whole-body kinematics, muscle activity, and neural signals were simultaneously recorded during execution of the trained tasks over multiple days of testing. Hindlimb kinematics, muscle activity, gait phases, and locomotor tasks were decoded using offline classification algorithms.\nMain results: We found that the stance and swing phases of gait and the locomotor tasks were detected with accuracies as robust as 90% in all rats. Decoded hindlimb kinematics and muscle activity exhibited a larger variability across rats and tasks.\nSignificance: Our study shows that the rodent motor cortex contains useful information for lower limb neuroprosthetic development. However, brain-machine interfaces estimating gait phases or locomotor behaviors, instead of continuous variables such as limb joint positions or speeds, are likely to provide more robust control strategies for the design of such neuroprostheses."

    "title": "Neural control of on-line guidance of hand reaching movements",
    "abstract": "Orienting one's gaze towards a peripheral target is usually composed of a hypometric primary saccade followed by a secondary 'corrective saccade' triggered automatically (without conscious perception) by the retinal error at the end of the primary saccade and characterised by a short latency. Due to visual suppression during the saccade, the artificial introduction of a random small target jump during that short period remains undetected and triggers after the end of the primary saccade a normal 'corrective saccade'. As a result this procedure simulates an error in the planning of the primary saccade. On the other hand optimum hand pointing (trade-off between movement time and accuracy) is considered classically to involve a natural parallel initiation of saccade and hand response based on a poor peripheral retinal location, and a further amendment of the hand motor response based on the retinal error provided by the simultaneous vision of target and hand during the movement home phase. To test the hypothesis that the retinal feedback at the end of the primary saccade is used to update the visual target position and amend the ongoing hand motor response, we developed a paradigm involving both an optimum hand pointing and an undetected random target perturbation during the orienting saccade. In order to show that the amendments were controlled by a loop comparing the perceived target location with the dynamic hand position signal, vision of the limb was removed at movement onset. Results showed that the movement was smoothly monitored on-line without additional time processing demands. This functional property of flexibility of the ongoing hand motor response, was generalized from movement extent to movement direction. The undetectability of the perturbation at a conscious level was not a prerequisite for motor flexibility, which was further shown to depend on a critical phase of the limb movement beyond which the latter was no longer amendable, even when the limb was visible. The hand pointing flexibility was further generalised from pointing to the more complex hand reaching and grasping process. It was shown that the flexibility of both the transport and the grasp components were closely coupled. A careful analysis of the data suggested the controlled variable to be the general posture of the upper limb, reaching Bernstein's intuitions about redundancy reduction in skeletomotor systems with degrees of freedom in excess. A kinematics study of the motor flexibility of reaching and grasping in a patient with a bilateral optic ataxia favoured the idea of a posterior parietal cortex involvement in the error processing underlying motor flexibility, reaching the same conclusions as other recent studies using either Positron Emission Tomography or Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation."

    "abstract": "Background: Muscle spasticity is a common impediment to motor recovery in patients with chronic stroke. Standard-of-care treatments such as botulinum toxin injections can temporarily relieve muscle stiffness and pain associated with spasticity, but often at the expense of increased muscle weakness. Recent preclinical investigations of a non-invasive treatment that pairs trans-spinal direct current stimulation and peripheral nerve direct current stimulation (tsDCS+pDCS) provided promising data for a novel approach based on bioelectronic medicine for the treatment of patients with post-stroke spasticity.\nMethods: Twenty-six patients with upper limb hemiparesis and wrist spasticity at least 6 months after their initial stroke participated in this single-blind crossover design study to test whether tsDCS+pDCS reduces chronic upper-extremity spasticity. Subjects received five consecutive daily sessions (20 min of stimulation or sham) of anodal tsDCS+pDCS, separated by a one-week washout period. The sham condition always preceded the active condition. Clinical and objective measures of spasticity and motor function were collected before and after each condition, and for five weeks after the completion of the active intervention.\nResults: Subjects treated with active tsDCS+pDCS demonstrated significant reductions in both Modified Tardieu Scale scores (summed across the upper limb, P < 0.05), and in objective torque measures (Nm) of the spastic catch response at the wrist flexor (P < 0.05), compared to the sham condition. Motor function also improved significantly (measured by the Fugl-Meyer and Wolf Motor Function Test; P < 0.05 for both tests) after active treatment.\nConclusions: tsDCS+pDCS intervention alone significantly reduced upper limb spasticity in participants with stroke. Decreased spasticity was persistent for five weeks after treatment, and was accompanied by improved motor function even though patients were unsupervised and there was no prescribed activity or training during that interval.\nTrial registration: NCT03080454, March 15, 2017."

    "title": "Systematic Review on Kinematic Assessments of Upper Limb Movements After Stroke",
    "abstract": "Background and Purpose- Assessing upper limb movements poststroke is crucial to monitor and understand sensorimotor recovery. Kinematic assessments are expected to enable a sensitive quantification of movement quality and distinguish between restitution and compensation. The nature and practice of these assessments are highly variable and used without knowledge of their clinimetric properties. This presents a challenge when interpreting and comparing results. The purpose of this review was to summarize the state of the art regarding kinematic upper limb assessments poststroke with respect to the assessment task, measurement system, and performance metrics with their clinimetric properties. Subsequently, we aimed to provide evidence-based recommendations for future applications of upper limb kinematics in stroke recovery research. Methods- A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore. Studies investigating clinimetric properties of applied metrics were assessed for risk of bias using the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments checklist. The quality of evidence for metrics was determined according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results- A total of 225 studies (N=6197) using 151 different kinematic metrics were identified and allocated to 5 task and 3 measurement system groups. Thirty studies investigated clinimetrics of 62 metrics: reliability (n=8), measurement error (n=5), convergent validity (n=22), and responsiveness (n=2). The metrics task/movement time, number of movement onsets, number of movement ends, path length ratio, peak velocity, number of velocity peaks, trunk displacement, and shoulder flexion/extension received a sufficient evaluation for one clinimetric property. Conclusions- Studies on kinematic assessments of upper limb sensorimotor function are poorly standardized and rarely investigate clinimetrics in an unbiased manner. Based on the available evidence, recommendations on the assessment task, measurement system, and performance metrics were made with the goal to increase standardization. Further high-quality studies evaluating clinimetric properties are needed to validate kinematic assessments, with the long-term goal to elucidate upper limb sensorimotor recovery poststroke.

Meanwhile, the feature extraction method adopted in EMG-PR based control is considered as an important factor that influences the performance of the prostheses. By exploiting the limitations of the existing feature extraction methods, this study proposed a new feature extraction method to effectively characterize EMG signal patterns associated with different limb movement intent. The performance of the proposed 2-dimensional novel time-domain feature set (NTDFS) was investigated using classification accuracy and feature space separability metrics across five subjects' EMG recordings, and compared with four different existing methods. In comparison to four other previously proposed feature extraction methods, the NTDFS achieved significantly better performance with increment in accuracy in the range of 5.20% ∼ 8.40% at p<0.05. Additionally, by applying principal component analysis (PCA) technique, the PCA feature space for NTDFS show obvious class separability in comparison to the other existing feature extraction methods. Thus, the proposed NTDFS may facilitate the development of accurate and robust clinically viable EMG-PR based prostheses."

In this study, 10 prostheses were implanted in each patient with FI under local anesthesia and under endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) guidance, into the upper-middle intersphincteric space of the anal canal by a specifically designed delivery system. EAUS was used postoperatively to assess prostheses dislocation.\nResults: Ten patients (5 females; median age 58 years, range 20-75) were enrolled and treated with SphinKeeper(TM) implantation. Median duration of procedure (performed by endoanal ultrasound guidance) was 40 min (range 30-45). Neither intraoperative nor postoperative complications were reported after a 3-month follow-up. In one patient, a partial dislocation of a single prosthesis was documented by EAUS, causing anal discomfort which resolved after 1 week.\nConclusion: SphinKeeper(TM) can be safely implanted in patients with FI of different etiology. Implantation was well tolerated with no dislodgment of implants at 3-month follow-up."

    "title": "Neuromuscular stimulation after stroke: from technology to clinical deployment",
    "abstract": "Since the early 1960s, electrical or neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been used to support the rehabilitation of stroke patients. One of the earliest applications of NMES included the use of external muscle stimulation to correct drop-foot after stroke. During the last few decades various clinical applications have been used for the upper and lower limb. Despite a growing body of literature on the use of NMES, its application in stroke is still limited to a few clinical groups that provide dedicated clinical services. Some explanations for the limited use are the sometimes conflicting clinical evidence, the size of the effects or the complicated use of the technology itself. This review points out three directions for future research. First, we need to expand our knowledge on brain plasticity and the use of different electrical stimulation strategies to modulate the neural system. Second, we foresee an increase in therapies combining different training principles, for example, the combination of NMES and robotics or neuromodulating drugs. Finally, with the ever-increasing pressure on healthcare budgets, it is expected that clinical and economic evidence will become more relevant in transferring these interventions to a wider community."

    "title": "Continuous Estimation of Human Multi-Joint Angles From sEMG Using a State-Space Model",
    "abstract": "Due to the couplings among joint-relative muscles, it is a challenge to accurately estimate continuous multi-joint movements from multi-channel sEMG signals. Traditional approaches always build a nonlinear regression model, such as artificial neural network, to predict the multi-joint movement variables using sEMG as inputs. However, the redundant sEMG-data are always not distinguished; the prediction errors cannot be evaluated and corrected online as well. In this work, a correlation-based redundancy-segmentation method is proposed to segment the sEMG-vector including redundancy into irredundant and redundant subvectors. Then, a general state-space framework is developed to build the motion model by regarding the irredundant subvector as input and the redundant one as measurement output. With the built state-space motion model, a closed-loop prediction-correction algorithm, i.e., the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), can be employed to estimate the multi-joint angles from sEMG, where the redundant sEMG-data are used to reject model uncertainties. After having fully employed the redundancy, the proposed method can provide accurate and smooth estimation results. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the multi-joint movements of the upper limb. The maximum RMSE of the estimations obtained by the proposed method is 0.16±0.03, which is significantly less than 0.25±0.06 and 0.27±0.07 (p < 0.05) obtained by common neural networks."

    "title": "Noninvasive assessment of cardiac output by brachial occlusion-cuff technique: comparison with the open-circuit acetylene washin method",
    "abstract": "Cardiac output (CO) assessment as a basic hemodynamic parameter has been of interest in exercise physiology, cardiology, and anesthesiology. Noninvasive techniques available are technically challenging, and thus difficult to use outside of a clinical or laboratory setting. We propose a novel method of noninvasive CO assessment using a single, upper-arm cuff. The method uses the arterial pressure pulse wave signal acquired from the brachial artery during 20-s intervals of suprasystolic occlusion. This method was evaluated in a cohort of 12 healthy individuals (age, 27.7 ± 5.4 yr, 50% men) and compared with an established method for noninvasive CO assessment, the open-circuit acetylene method (OpCirc) at rest, and during low- to moderate-intensity exercise. CO increased from rest to exercise (rest, 7.4 ± 0.8 vs. 7.2 ± 0.8; low, 9.8 ± 1.8 vs. 9.9 ± 2.0; moderate, 14.1 ± 2.8 vs. 14.8 ± 3.2 l/min) as assessed by the cuff-occlusion and OpCirc techniques, respectively. The average error of experimental technique compared with OpCirc was -0.25 ± 1.02 l/min, Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.96 (rest + exercise), and 0.21 ± 0.42 l/min with Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.87 (rest only). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated good agreement between methods (within 95% boundaries); the reproducibility coefficient (RPC) = 0.84 l/min with R2 = 0.75 at rest and RPC = 2 l/min with R2 = 0.92 at rest and during exercise, respectively. In comparison with an established method to quantify CO, the cuff-occlusion method provides similar measures at rest and with light to moderate exercise. Thus, we believe this method has the potential to be used as a new, noninvasive method for assessing CO during exercise."

    "title": "Electrically stimulated signals from a long-term Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface",
    "abstract": "Despite modern technological advances, the most widely available prostheses provide little functional recovery beyond basic grasping. Although sophisticated upper extremity prostheses are available, optimal prosthetic interfaces which give patients high-fidelity control of these artificial limbs are limited. We have developed a novel Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface (RPNI), which consists of a unit of free muscle that has been neurotized by a transected peripheral nerve. In conjunction with a biocompatible electrode on the muscle surface, the RPNI facilitates signal transduction from a residual peripheral nerve to a neuroprosthetic limb. The purpose of this study was to explore signal quality and reliability in an RPNI following an extended period of implantation. Following a 14-month maturation period, electromyographic signal generation was evaluated via electrical stimulation of the innervating nerve. The long-term RPNI was viable and healthy, as demonstrated by evoked compound muscle action potentials as well as histological tissue analysis. Signals exceeding 4 mV were successfully acquired and amplitudes were consistent across multiple repetitions of applied stimuli. There were no evident signs of muscle denervation, significant scar tissue, or muscle necrosis. This study provides further evidence that after a maturation period exceeding 1 year, reliable and consistent signals can still be acquired from an RPNI."

    "title": "Simultaneous, proportional, multi-axis prosthesis control using multichannel surface EMG",
    "abstract": "Most upper limb prosthesis controllers only allow the individual selection and control of single joints of the limb. The main limiting factor for simultaneous multi-joint control is usually the availability of reliable independent control signals that can intuitively be used. In this paper, a novel method is presented for extraction of individual muscle source signals from surface EMG array recordings, based on EMG energy orthonormalization along principle movement vectors. In cases where independently-controllable muscles are present in residual limbs, this method can be used to provide simultaneous, multi-axis, proportional control of prosthetic systems. Initial results are presented for simultaneous control of wrist rotation, wrist flexion/extension, and grip open/close for two intact subjects under both isometric and non-isometric conditions and for one subject with transradial amputation."

    "title": "Development of an EMG-Based Muscle Health Model for Elbow Trauma Patients",
    "abstract": "Wearable robotic braces have the potential to improve rehabilitative therapies for patients suffering from musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions. Ideally, a quantitative assessment of health would be incorporated into rehabilitative devices to monitor patient recovery. The purpose of this work is to develop a model to distinguish between the healthy and injured arms of elbow trauma patients based on electromyography (EMG) data. Surface EMG recordings were collected from the healthy and injured limbs of 30 elbow trauma patients while performing 10 upper-limb motions. Forty-two features and five feature sets were extracted from the data. Feature selection was performed to improve the class separation and to reduce the computational complexity of the feature sets. The following classifiers were tested: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). The classifiers were used to distinguish between two levels of health: healthy and injured (50% baseline accuracy rate). Maximum fractal length (MFL), myopulse percentage rate (MYOP), power spectrum ratio (PSR) and spike shape analysis features were identified as the best features for classifying elbow muscle health. A majority vote of the LDA classification models provided a cross-validation accuracy of 82.1%. The work described in this paper indicates that it is possible to discern between healthy and injured limbs of patients with MSK elbow injuries. Further assessment and optimization could improve the consistency and accuracy of the classification models. This work is the first of its kind to identify EMG metrics for muscle health assessment by wearable rehabilitative devices."

    "title": "Classification of simultaneous movements using surface EMG pattern recognition",
    "abstract": "Advanced upper limb prostheses capable of actuating multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) are now commercially available. Pattern recognition algorithms that use surface electromyography (EMG) signals show great promise as multi-DOF controllers. Unfortunately, current pattern recognition systems are limited to activate only one DOF at a time. This study introduces a novel classifier based on Bayesian theory to provide classification of simultaneous movements. This approach and two other classification strategies for simultaneous movements were evaluated using nonamputee and amputee subjects classifying up to three DOFs, where any two DOFs could be classified simultaneously. Similar results were found for nonamputee and amputee subjects. The new approach, based on a set of conditional parallel classifiers was the most promising with errors significantly less (p < 0.05) than a single linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier or a parallel approach. For three-DOF classification, the conditional parallel approach had error rates of 6.6% on discrete and 10.9% on combined motions, while the single LDA had error rates of 9.4% on discrete and 14.1% on combined motions. The low error rates demonstrated suggest than pattern recognition techniques on surface EMG can be extended to identify simultaneous movements, which could provide more life-like motions for amputees compared to exclusively classifying sequential movements."

    "title": "Advances in selective activation of muscles for non-invasive motor neuroprostheses",
    "abstract": "Non-invasive neuroprosthetic (NP) technologies for movement compensation and rehabilitation remain with challenges for their clinical application. Two of those major challenges are selective activation of muscles and fatigue management. This review discusses how electrode arrays improve the efficiency and selectivity of functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied via transcutaneous electrodes. In this paper we review the principles and achievements during the last decade on techniques for artificial motor unit recruitment to improve the selective activation of muscles. We review the key factors affecting the outcome of muscle force production via multi-pad transcutaneous electrical stimulation and discuss how stimulation parameters can be set to optimize external activation of body segments. A detailed review of existing electrode array systems proposed by different research teams is also provided. Furthermore, a review of the targeted applications of existing electrode arrays for control of upper and lower limb NPs is provided. Eventually, last section demonstrates the potential of electrode arrays to overcome the major challenges of NPs for compensation and rehabilitation of patient-specific impairments."

    "title": "[Study on the method of microelectrodes implantation of artificial facial nerve prosthesis in closed mouth of orbicularis oris muscle in monkeys with facial nerve paralysis]",
    "abstract": "Objective: To explore the optimal method of microelectrode implantation that can produce efficient mouth closure with microelectrode for orbicularis oris muscle (OOM) in rhesus monkeys with unilateral peripheral facial paralysis (UPFP) in order to provide basis for the research and development of artificial facial nerve prosthesis (AFNP). Methods: Right lateral peripheral facial paralysis model on four healthy rhesus monkeys (two males and two femles, aged 5-6 years, weighed 2.0-3.0 kg) were prepared. AFNP electric stimulation was used to induce closed-mouth reaction of the affected OOM with a one-way rectangular pulse, 50 Hz frequency and 0.2 ms pulse width in vitro. Around the affected lateral OOM, four stimulus electrodes implantation positions were selected at the upper lip (position A), the lower lip (position B), the connection with the corner of the mouth to the ipsilateral tragus (position C), and the horizontal line of the mouth angle (position D). According to the different implantation positions of three stimulation electrodes on the stimulation side of AFNP and the results of our previous study, six groups of microelectrode implantation methods were designed. In Group A, two microelectrodes were implanted at position A and one microelectrode was implanted at position B; in Group B, one microelectrode was implanted at position A, B and C respectively; in Group C, one microelectrode was implanted at position A and two microelectrodes were implanted at position B; in Group D, one microelectrode was implanted at position A, B and D respectively; in Group E, one microelectrode was implanted at position A, C and D respectively; in Group F, one microelectrode was implanted at position B, C and D respectively. The minimum stimulating current (threshold current) required for effective mouth closure were recorded. The threshold and peak current values were compared using one-way ANOVA and LSD-t multiple comparisons. Results: The microelectrodes of the AFNP stimulating side in Group E and F failed to induce a smooth mouth closure. The microelectrodes in A, B, C and D group induced smooth mouth closure. The threshold current value of OOM contraction on affected side in the Group A, B, C, and D were (1.35±0.05), (1.02±0.04), (1.40±0.04) and (1.10±0.02) mA, respectively (F=295.302, P<0.001), with the lowest value in Group B and there was significant difference between the current value in Group B and those in the other groups (all P<0.05). The peak current value of OOM contraction on affected side in the four groups were (3.95±0.02), (2.95±0.03), (3.99±0.05) and (3.51±0.01) mA, respectively (F=1 014.985, P<0.001). Group B showed the best lip-closure morphology observed with naked eyes. Conclusions: When three output microelectrode of the AFNP stimulated side are separately imbedded into the upper lip, the lower lip and the connection with the corner of the mouth to the ipsilateral tragus, AFNP can sufficiently induce closed-mouth reaction. These positions are suitable as priority options microelectrodes implantation positions for the microelectrodes of the AFNP stimulated side."

    "title": "Muscle length and joint angle influence spinal but not corticospinal excitability to the biceps brachii across forearm postures",
    "abstract": "Forearm rotation (supination/pronation) alters corticospinal excitability to the biceps brachii, but it is unclear whether corticospinal excitability is influenced by joint angle, muscle length, or both. Thus the purpose of this study was to separately examine elbow joint angle and muscle length on corticospinal excitability. Corticospinal excitability to the biceps and triceps brachii was measured using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited via transcranial magnetic stimulation. Spinal excitability was measured using cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials (CMEPs) elicited via transmastoid electrical stimulation. Elbow angles were manipulated with a fixed biceps brachii muscle length (and vice versa) across five unique postures: 1) forearm neutral, elbow flexion 90°; 2) forearm supinated, elbow flexion 90°; 3) forearm pronated, elbow flexion 90°; 4) forearm supinated, elbow flexion 78°; and 5) forearm pronated, elbow flexion 113°. A musculoskeletal model determined biceps brachii muscle length for postures 1-3, and elbow joint angles (postures 4-5) were selected to maintain biceps length across forearm orientations. MEPs and CMEPs were elicited at rest and during an isometric contraction of 10% of maximal biceps muscle activity. At rest, MEP amplitudes to the biceps were largest during supination, which was independent of elbow joint angle. CMEP amplitudes were not different when the elbow was fixed at 90° but were largest in pronation when muscle length was controlled. During an isometric contraction, there were no significant differences across forearm postures for either MEP or CMEP amplitudes. These results highlight that elbow joint angle and biceps brachii muscle length can each independently influence spinal excitability. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Changes in upper limb posture can influence the responsiveness of the central nervous system to artificial stimulations. We established a novel approach integrating neurophysiology techniques with biomechanical modeling. Through this approach, the effects of elbow joint angle and biceps brachii muscle length on corticospinal and spinal excitability were assessed. We demonstrate that spinal excitability is uniquely influenced by joint angle and muscle length, and this highlights the importance of accounting for muscle length in neurophysiological studies."
